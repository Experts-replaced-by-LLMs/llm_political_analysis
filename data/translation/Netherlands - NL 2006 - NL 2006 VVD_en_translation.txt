We have a lot in the Netherlands to be proud of.
But a number of things need to improve.
The world is changing rapidly and we will have to respond to this effectively.
No old solutions for new problems.
This requires clear choices.
Exactly what elections are about.
Politicians make mistakes just like everyone else.
Not a problem in itself, as long as one learns from it.
Such a mistake is to continue to hesitate against inevitable changes for too long.
Daring to take action is a good Dutch quality.
Just like telling what it's about.
In understandable language, short and clear.
We have a lot to gain in the coming years, but we have to choose to do so.
We choose a welcoming society,
but also for strict requirements for newcomers.
We choose lifelong learning and self-development,
for the pleasure of work for everyone who can.
We choose a government that is there for everyone.
We opt for clear rules with clear consequences.
And we also choose a society that offers opportunities to everyone, without distinction.
Because we want a society with ambition, for everyone!
Income tax will be reduced by 3 percent for all tax brackets.
Almost every Dutch person benefits.
These are net euros that everyone can use.
The VVD will keep the AOW retirement age at 65.
From that age you no longer pay premiums for this: no further taxation.
The older generations have a right to that.
No ambiguity, but clarity.
The mortgage interest deduction is a given for the VVD.
This certainty is the basis for a healthy housing market.
We don't want to put a bomb under that.
The tax cut gives virtually all households more purchasing power.
This also prevents a wage wave and the risk of a new economic recession.
The usual wage demands can, in fact, remain limited.
In short, people have more left over, without our country becoming too expensive for foreign countries.
This is how the Netherlands maintains its growth.
Solid government finances mean continuing to repay the national debt.
Now we all lose 13 billion in interest every year.
In line with the famous Salmon norm, budget windfalls must continue to be used for debt repayment.
No squandering money at the expense of our children.
Our economy cannot survive without skilled workers.
Schools must restore craftsmanship to its former glory.
Vocational education can once again radiate pride.
In pre-vocational secondary education, more intensive contact with practice is a necessity for both students and teachers.
Away with the idea that theory is more important than practice.
Entrepreneurship is encouraged.
It lowers the threshold if, for example, you have already written a business plan at school, know how to borrow money from the bank or what the tax authorities require of you.
Schools for secondary vocational education and higher professional education should help recent graduates with knowledge and funds to start their own business.
Provide guidance and invest together.
Occasional refresher courses and open access to knowledge strengthen the lifelong bond between school and student.
Successful former students can also tell their story in front of the class: nothing is as inspiring as a role model.
If you want politics to come alive, you have to speak clearly.
People should be able to follow discussions and decisions.
Much of the language used by civil servants and politicians is full of abbreviations and jargon that is not understood outside The Hague.
Clarity in language forces politicians to make choices based on main points, away from the square millimeter.
A new cabinet must agree that all plans, demands and regulations that affect people will be tested for language use.
This also applies to government application forms for, say, child benefit or a building permit.
Inaccessibility must be eradicated.
For understandable politics.
More than 180 nationalities live in our country.
That offers opportunities and problems.
To increase opportunities, any form of unacceptable discrimination must be eliminated.
That is why the VVD strongly adheres to Article 1 of the Constitution: discrimination is 'not permitted'.
In our society it should not matter what someone's origin is, whether someone is male or female, or what their sexual orientation is.
No discrimination in the labour market, in access to facilities and in interactions between citizens.
Article 1 of the Constitution is called Article 1 for a reason.
It is the standard of decency of and for our society.
That is why Article 1 must take precedence over our other fundamental rights.
For example, schools will no longer be able to rely on freedom of education or religion to, say, exclude a homosexual teacher or a Muslim intern.
Furthermore, it should be possible to go to the subdistrict court yourself in the event of obvious discrimination in job applications – which goes beyond the functional distinction.
Childcare will be free for working and entrepreneurial parents.
The VVD believes it is important that family care and career can go hand in hand.
Working mothers are good mothers too.
Free childcare provides a huge boost to the economy through increased labor participation.
Anyone with special requests for childcare will have to pay extra.
The VVD has already achieved that all primary schools must offer before- and after-school care for children aged four to twelve, if the parents so wish.
There will be room every working day from half past seven in the morning until half past six in the evening.
Schools have been offering this facility since August 1, 2007.
More than 12,000 administrators and representatives are busy governing the Netherlands day in, day out.
The national government, twelve provinces, 458 municipalities, dozens of sub-municipalities and city districts, and many hundreds of other administrative bodies represent the interests of sixteen million inhabitants.
Ministers, provincial executives, aldermen and mayors rush from one meeting to the next and very often encounter the same people at all these meetings.
What is needed is a radical reduction in administrative density at all levels: at least a quarter can be cut!
What applies to the country also applies to The Hague: the House of Representatives can be reduced from 150 to 100 seats.
At the same time, the First Chamber can increase from 75 to 50 seats.
Then the debate turns to the main issues.
The tax you pay on an inheritance is bitter and unfair.
People have often saved for a long time, for example to pay off their house.
When they die, that money goes to the heirs, often the children.
Tax has already been paid on this money.
So let's start by reducing this 'inheritance tax' by half, just like gift tax.
Away with inheritance tax!
If you hit a random person, you hit a civilian – and you should be punished.
If you hit a police officer, a teacher, an ambulance attendant or a train conductor, you hit someone who acts on behalf of all of us – and you deserve, so to speak, triple the punishment.
Then you get a big push without any mercy.
It's time we support all our representatives in society.
They fulfill important roles and need to feel supported.
Therefore, we must punish violations against such authorities more severely.
Liberalism is an old and powerful political movement.
It emerged in the seventeenth century from the struggle against absolute state power and the religious wars.
Liberal thinkers then discovered what makes a society free: private property, legal certainty, freedom of conscience and expression.
They always put the rights of the individual first.
The VVD is the main proponent of this ideology in the Netherlands.
We liberals have enormous faith in the power of every human being.
How you develop, what you consider important, who you do things with, how you can earn money: people know best themselves.
Politics must create the conditions.
It is precisely the respect for everyone's individual freedom that makes our society richly diverse, close-knit and resilient.
Obviously, rules are needed to live well together with sixteen million people.
In their private domain, people are entitled to maximum freedom.
This requires extreme restraint from the government in the areas of private matters such as sex, parenthood, lifestyle, fulfillment of life, dealing with illness and death.
The government must intervene when private abuses occur, such as child abuse or domestic violence.
However, no matter how well-intentioned, it must not impose on man how to live and how to die.
The right to self-determination is an important right for liberals.
Freedom is the highest good in a democracy.
She is threatened in ever new ways, even now.
That is why the VVD, like no other party, fights for a country and a life in freedom.
Starting your own business is often experienced as a leap into the unknown.
Hassle with rules, difficult to get money.
There are still too few starters in our country.
We therefore want to double the number of starters in four years.
Giving people with courage a chance.
Nothing is as good for the mood in the economy.
That is why there will be a tax holiday for starters: new companies will be exempt from tax on profits for the first three years.
Losses remain deductible; We do not allow fraud to occur.
The tax authorities and the Chamber of Commerce offer better and faster service: one starter desk where you can arrange all your affairs.
On the other hand, it must be legally and socially acceptable to go bankrupt.
Restarting should become easier.
An entrepreneur who ends up with debts should in principle be able to start again with a clean slate within three years.
Transferring a company, for example to your children, should become more tax-efficient.
Too often, organised distrust stifles personal initiative and entrepreneurship.
The government spends endless time on forms and pre-production checks and on inspection during production.
While it should be about checking afterwards: what comes off the production line and how?
That is why all those pre-stamps and permits should be largely abolished.
You have to start with trust.
However, the rules of the game must be crystal clear, so that everyone knows what they have to adhere to.
The downside is that anyone who damages trust must suffer the harsh consequences.
Better ten rules with one strict inspector than an impenetrable jungle of rules.
From distrust to trust: it is a gigantic shift in thinking.
It drastically saves costs for the government,
gives air to companies,
but requires strict enforcement.
Government interference should also be reduced in other ways.
Fewer subsidy schemes for all sorts of things.
And the shop closing time law will be abolished.
The VVD wants as many people as possible to be and remain employed.
Society desperately needs the energy and experience of newcomers, women and the older generation.
Labor participation is the best path to integration.
This opportunity should be available to all new Dutch citizens.
We want more women in higher positions.
It is time to break through the male bastion in business and government, for example by publishing companies and governments that are lagging behind in this regard.
Working longer after retirement should be possible.
It's crazy that people who want to participate until they are 67 or 70 are being sidelined.
Collective labour agreements that prohibit this should not be declared generally binding.
Entrepreneurs who continue to work after the age of 65 retain their self-employed persons' deduction.
Incentive measures are being taken to ensure that people work more and that as many people as possible work at least until the age of 65.
Employers contribute to this by, for example, recruiting people who are re-entering the workforce or people on social assistance.
In this context, the tax credit for non-working partners will also be phased out over twenty years.
What is urgent is better individual portability of pensions and more clarity about what happens when switching.
There is a global war for talent underway.
The Netherlands must radiate hospitality in order to be attractive.
So we have to be smart about immigration.
Smart by focusing on educated people.
Companies that want to attract experts or talent from abroad should not encounter unnecessary bureaucracy.
But also smart because we look at who we can build a good future with.
Some people are welcome purely on the basis of personal talents: an innovative entrepreneur, an independent researcher or a top creative talent.
They are assessed on the basis of a clear points system.
The greater the value of an immigrant to our labor market, the more points are awarded and therefore the easier it is for that person to enter.
Companies must also be able to employ foreign seasonal workers.
However, this temporary work does not entail family reunification or the right to social security.
We must always make clear choices by setting strict requirements.
But once inside, you should feel welcome.
Your neighbor girl has a good idea, like setting up a nail salon.
The very beginning is often the biggest step.
She needs 4,000 euros, but because she has no steady income, the bank is not coming up with the money.
If, after her enthusiastic explanations, you decide to invest those 4,000 euros, you are taking a big risk.
Precisely the reason why the bank does not start.
That risk must therefore be rewarded handsomely, because all those starting neighbourhood girls and boys are the engine of job growth.
Therefore, the risk bearer does not have to pay tax on the invested capital for the first three years and the losses must be deductible.
Raising children is a privilege.
Parents who abuse that should lose it.
Government procrastination will only lead to permanent serious damage to the child.
They often face a difficult or even criminal life.
That is terrible for them and bad for society.
Quick and decisive intervention is required, also in the case of 0-4 year olds and, if necessary, against the wishes of the parents.
Prevention and aftercare are not forgotten.
If a child is in trouble, there should always be only one agency that is ultimately responsible.
Agencies are bundled as much as possible at municipal level, as close to the child as possible.
Waiting lists for children requiring treatment are being cleared.
The options for adoption and foster parenting are being expanded.
Permanent jobs for life no longer exist.
Everyone makes a transition in their career at some point.
Sometimes circumstances force you to do something.
But unemployed?
No, you are 'between jobs'.
Both employees and employers have that agility.
Dismissal law must be simpler and clearer based on fixed criteria and a standard compensation.
One point of contact for administrative processing: the CWI.
Then everyone knows where they stand.
To encourage people to look for new work more quickly, the maximum duration of unemployment benefits will be halved from 38 to 19 months.
These rules will also apply to civil servants and political office holders.
The unemployment benefit will increase slightly for the first three months, to 80 percent of the last earned salary.
Employers are making substantially more efforts to train and retrain their staff ('lifelong learning').
No employee then needs to be like a rabbit in the headlights of an impending restructuring.
Resilient on the way to the next job.
Or your own business!
No one in our society needs to live in poverty.
That's a matter of civilization.
That is why we in the Netherlands have an excellent social safety net for people who are truly unable to work (anymore).
Many people who spent years as 'unemployable' in the card indexes of social services have ended up there.
Social policy should therefore always be aimed at finding work, an internship or training: away from benefits.
If people do not make sufficient efforts, do not learn the language or commit fraud, sanctions are appropriate.
There will always be a group for whom paid work is a step too far.
These people receive assistance,
but in return we ask those who can to give something back to society.
Think of volunteer work or informal care.
This also prevents social isolation.
Social work also contributes to this.
There is no social assistance for those under the age of 27.
Young people can learn or work.
In the wake of global information flows, flows of goods are growing.
There are great opportunities here for the Netherlands as a highly transhipped transport country.
This requires a radical breakthrough in the design of our sea and airports and the rail, water and road networks.
The seaports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam are integrating their business structures.
New high-speed public transport connections are coming to the Randstad.
Connections with other economic regions, in the Netherlands and across the border, are being improved, including connections to high-speed networks.
Our airports must also be able to grow.
We have a short-term plan, but we must commit to innovating for the long term, for 2030.
This does not mean that one has to limit oneself to the current location, Schiphol.
The development of quiet and safe aircraft contributes substantially to a solution.
Traffic jams cause economic damage and are bad for the environment and road safety.
Therefore new roads must be constructed and existing roads widened or stacked,
without damaging valuable greenery.
Mileage pricing, which taxes the use of the car rather than its ownership, leads to more efficient use of the road.
To prevent an increase in costs, the luxury tax (bpm) and motor vehicle tax must be reduced or abolished accordingly when they are introduced.
Public transport needs to be improved to accommodate a larger share of rush hour traffic in particular.
Not with coercion, but with seduction - with space, calm and speed.
There needs to be faster legislation for major infrastructure projects.
Better opportunities for working from home are emerging, such as electronic broadband networks and tax adjustments.
Training together in the mud, cheering together for your club: sport brings people together.
Sport stimulates entrepreneurship, rewards personal initiative and contributes to a healthy lifestyle.
Sports clubs can also play a wonderful role in integration.
Top and recreational sports, including for the disabled, should be encouraged.
Sports clubs, national sports associations, schools and after-school care facilities must work closely together to ensure that school-going children exercise as much as possible, preferably five hours per week.
Top athletes are given the opportunity to develop through good facilities in the field of education and (medical) technology.
The Netherlands on its way to becoming a real sports country!
The Randstad is in fact a city of millions, like Paris, London or New York.
Administrative scaling up is therefore a must.
To begin with, the four provinces of North Holland, South Holland, Utrecht and Flevoland will be abolished and replaced by one Randstad province.
Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Almere and other cities work together within this framework.
This new province will not disrupt the 'balance' in our country, as the States of Holland used to do; At that time the provinces were the bearers of the state system, now the central government guarantees that unity.
Every young person is good at something.
One is handy, another is creative, a third is a good learner.
Schools and universities must offer every student the opportunity for a successful future through a variety of approaches.
Language lessons for toddlers pay off.
Especially among children of parents who do not speak Dutch well themselves.
It is a shame if children start grade 1 of primary school with a disadvantage.
This can be prevented by administering mandatory language tests at the child health clinic and by making children who score too low take mandatory language lessons.
Childcare will be free for working and entrepreneurial parents.
But at least as important is knowing that your child can play, do sports or do homework somewhere safe and pleasant.
Many schools are transforming into 'broad schools'.
After school they offer all facilities for sports, courses and language lessons, accessible to everyone in the neighbourhood.
With an investment of 150 million euros, a thousand primary schools can already build a new space or convert old classrooms into a childcare area or craft room.
The general level of knowledge in primary schools must increase.
Mathematics, Dutch, history and one foreign language, that is the basis for your future.
The secondary school builds on this
and adds attention to citizenship.
It is completely unacceptable that more than 50,000 young people leave school every year without a diploma.
Responsibility for this should be placed with the schools, which must keep the students on board in consultation with the parents.
You have to drag young people out of bed, involve them and not just passively – or sometimes secretly with relief – watch when they no longer show up.
The government ensures better enforcement of compulsory education and compulsory work education up to the age of 23.
Teachers have a fantastic profession, but are not sufficiently encouraged to shape and give content to their profession themselves.
They can actually only make a career as a manager within the school.
Many young, enthusiastic teachers go into the business world after a number of years of teaching.
Some are then hired by schools for a lot of money as educational consultants: the world turned upside down.
The teaching profession must and can be more interesting.
You build your career in the classroom.
For example, a good teacher should be able to earn more than an average one, so that it pays to put more energy into the profession.
Why wouldn't a good pre-vocational secondary education teacher be able to perform better than a mediocre pre-university education teacher?
The quality of teacher training must improve.
Further training is reimbursed once you have been teaching for five years.
This means three months of substantive refuelling – to be extra motivated to continue teaching again.
There will be less management.
The bureaucracy of large-scale operations is being curbed.
This gives room for personal interpretation of the subject.
Outside advice is being reduced.
Schools, use your own people.
Dutch universities and colleges must become more ambitious: demand more of themselves and of their students.
Wanting to be the first.
America and China now know how to attract the best students and scientists.
They must want to stay here – and come!
Top research benefits from intensive collaboration between universities and colleges in innovative, capital-intensive, inter- and/or multidisciplinary areas.
Institutions will be tested against this.
A larger portion of the budget will also have to be earned privately, including through research contracts and the peddling of intellectual property.
Universities and colleges must compete on education.
More variation in tuition fees, selection of new students and internationalisation make this possible.
In principle, there are no obstacles to the entry of new higher education providers, including foreign ones.
Invention and innovation are essential to the Dutch economy.
It makes us more competitive and, for example, we acquire cleaner transport, better healthcare and more sustainable housing.
Innovation is not only about technology, but also about people, about new ways of organizing and applying.
Being innovative often means approaching an issue from different angles or at the intersection of disciplines.
You cannot do that from one organization.
The most promising approach is open collaboration between companies (large companies and SMEs), knowledge institutions, universities and colleges and the government.
A regional approach, such as Brainport Eindhoven, and a national approach, such as with the SME vouchers, can both work.
Open the vaults of knowledge!
Safety is the oldest and most important task of the government.
Crystal clear rules of the game are crucial.
People need to know where they stand.
Consistent enforcement is also necessary.
Otherwise no one will take the rules seriously anymore.
Perpetrators of vandalism must know that they will not get away with it and must pay for the damage down to the last cent.
Parents become financially jointly liable for their minor children.
Mom and Dad's wallets are also upholding the law!
The mayor can issue fines for minor offences: the ‘aso-bon’.
Officers make careers on the streets, not at the police station.
To ensure that local cases are actually prosecuted, one public prosecutor works closely with the police officers in a neighborhood or village.
This permanent 'neighbourhood officer' knows what to bring to the attention of the judge.
He keeps local residents informed of judicial developments through the police.
A small group of criminals are responsible for the majority of the nuisance, shoplifting and pickpocketing.
That is why there should be more places in institutions for repeat offenders.
Retailers will have access to a national database containing photos and details of incorrigible pickpockets.
Anyone who arrests someone red-handed deserves better legal protection.
Someone who defends himself in his own home in the event of a burglary or theft should not be regarded as a suspect in advance.
Noise, mess, late-night drinking bouts and other misbehavior.
Such forms of serious nuisance can completely destroy the lives of local residents.
Local residents are often powerless and do not dare to report or file a complaint with the police due to threats and physical violence.
If neighbourhood mediation fails, landlords, the municipality and the police have a number of measures at their disposal: termination of the lease, placement in squalid homes or closure of the home.
Nuisance visitors may be banned from entering the street.
Sound systems may be confiscated.
In case of threats, the police must be ready immediately.
The mayor must choose for the neighborhood and therefore against the hooligans.
He or she can be helped in this by less excessive legal protection for those causing the nuisance.
These people are now too often given legal delay, at the expense of their neighbours.
The mayor must also be able to impose compulsory admission on psychiatric patients who cause a nuisance.
The vast majority of daily safety is close to the citizen and is served by local attention.
Mayors have sufficient people and resources at their disposal for this purpose.
However, a number of issues, such as combating terrorism and serious crime, require a permanent national approach (including international cooperation).
Local police and government naturally contribute to such nationally established goals.
There will finally be a Minister of Security.
This determines the policy and national priorities regarding safety.
This includes police, intelligence, terrorism, border control, crisis and disaster management, social security and public prosecution.
The crime solving rate must increase.
A national database with the DNA of convicts can help with this.
Also necessary is the permanent availability of all investigative information for the police everywhere in the country.
All technical obstacles to this will be removed as soon as possible.
Legal redress requires swift and appropriate punishment of the perpetrator.
After a conviction, the offender's prison sentence should start more quickly: straight to jail.
To relieve the pressure on prisons, more use will be made of multi-person cells and the possibility of release on bail for pre-trial detainees will be introduced.
Early release should not be automatic.
Community service sentences are becoming heavier and longer.
After all, an 'alternative punishment' must remain a punishment.
Legal redress after a crime also means protecting the victim.
In this way, in the event of compensation being awarded to the victim, the state takes over the collection of the claim from the perpetrator.
After all, the government is much better equipped than an abused elderly person or a robbed shopkeeper to go after a criminal's money.
Our country is always presented as small, densely populated and densely built.
But the Netherlands is not full.
At the current building density and activity, only 12.2 percent of the land area is built on.
For living, working and infrastructure.
As much as 87.8 percent is undeveloped, of which three quarters is agricultural land.
A small part is forest, water, recreation and other nature.
Valuable greenery must be protected, as must plant and animal species that are threatened with extinction.
Children especially should be able to experience nature.
In rural areas, people see the facilities in their village deteriorate.
Housing can contribute to the quality of life and business activity in rural areas.
Calculations show that three homes provide one structural job
Building gives villages vitality.
It offers young people the opportunity to stay in their own village and new residents the chance of that house in the green.
Permanent residence of recreational homes is permitted;
of course residents must contribute to local facilities
People should be able to decide for themselves where and how they live.
The overly detailed Building Decree is being replaced by broad rules.
Why does a door have to be 2.30 m high?
Aesthetic committees and regulations will be abolished, except for monumental buildings and protected townscapes and village views.
Enforcement of remaining building regulations should be tightened.
More plots of land should be made available for self-build.
Young people should be able to get a home more quickly: purchase or rent.
This means building more owner-occupied homes, especially for the elderly and first-time buyers, and accelerating the flow on the rental market.
For example, by allowing (new) tenants to choose between a contract with a longer or shorter term.
After the abolition of the user portion, the property tax for homeowners has now also been abolished.
In addition, transfer tax will be abolished in the long term.
Finally an end to those weird housing and moving taxes!
We can do a lot to improve the quality of life and integration in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
For example, not allocating housing on the basis of socio-economic criteria and promoting home ownership.
And let's be clear about squatting: that's not possible.
Your property must be safe.
Municipalities are being given more options to combat long-term vacancy.
But even now they should not tolerate or even invite squatters.
So quickly get a squatting ban.
The environment is a concern for all of us.
We must work together to keep our air, water and soil clean.
That is in behavior.
Technological innovation – greener and smarter production – holds the main key to solutions.
We must make strong efforts to achieve this.
At the same time, the government must impose and enforce strict environmental standards.
The importance of sustainability must be reflected in all levels of government policy and be stimulated privately.
The environment is an equal element in the considerations, not a side issue or a residual item to be bought off.
Good environmental policy can be a source of innovation
and an engine of economic growth.
Consider the development and export of knowledge in energy and water management.
If we succeed in connecting economy and ecology, caring for the environment can turn into an opportunity.
We must prepare for a significant reduction in fossil fuels in the coming decades.
It is irresponsible to exclude one or more sources of energy production for the future.
Nuclear energy is an essential part of the mix.
New research into and application of solar and nuclear energy, biomass and other sources is urgent.
Ensuring energy that is affordable for people and businesses is a shared European interest.
Sustainability also benefits from energy conservation.
Measures are being taken to comply with the agreements on biofuels and the Kyoto Protocol on reducing CO2 emissions.
Dutch agribusiness makes an important contribution to our prosperity.
For example, sixty percent of all ornamental horticulture products in the world are traded in the Netherlands and we export more than ten billion euros worth of meat, dairy and fish annually.
Forward-looking entrepreneurs focus on safe and sustainable production.
With greater concern than now for the welfare of the animals
and with attention to the landscape environment.
We support landscape and nature care as an important part of modern agricultural existence that deserves appreciation.
Agricultural subsidies and other market-distorting measures should be abolished worldwide based on a level playing field.
Production of alternative energy by the agricultural and horticultural sector is stimulated.
Research in agribusiness focuses on sustainable production.
The Wageningen Food Valley, where universities and innovative companies work together, shows how leading the Netherlands is in this area.
Land reclamation off the coast of South Holland is desirable according to the principle of 'Building with Nature'.
This protects the hinterland from the water, now that sea levels are rising and the ground is sinking.
This plan creates space for nature, recreation and housing in the overcrowded Randstad.
Seaward coastal expansion is also possible in North Holland and Zeeland.
Such projects are a huge boost for the Dutch economy and employment.
The acquired knowledge can be exported worldwide.
It also strengthens the feeling that we can do something in this country, such as the Afsluitdijk and the Delta Works in the past.
Proud of our new waterworks.
Just as we are proud of Rembrandt and enjoy the old Amsterdam canals, our achievements should be the pride of future generations.
A flourishing, diverse and high-quality art offering also contributes to social well-being.
Therefore, a substantial state share in the financing of art and the protection of cultural heritage is defensible.
Dutch companies in the culture and entertainment sector are strong, but operate in a rapidly changing world.
It is important that publishers and media companies are given more room to operate in multimedia.
Away with the imposed barriers between newspapers, television stations and internet companies.
Even in a diverse media landscape, a strong public broadcaster remains necessary.
For programs that commercial broadcasters do not offer but for which there is a need, such as philosophy of life, education and culture.
But especially because of all those programs that provide shared experiences, topics of conversation at the coffee machine: news, current affairs, national events and sports.
The public broadcaster must be able to broadcast sporting events.
‘Football back at NOS’ should not encounter political obstacles.
Sesame Street must stay.
Such a public broadcaster can operate with one less network and must save on overhead.
Programming should not be governed by ratings.
Public broadcasting does not have to be commercial-free: advertising is also part of the shared experience.
Anyone who wants to settle in the Netherlands must be able to participate in our society.
That is why the requirements for family migrants have become stricter in recent years.
Without integration, people miss out on all the opportunities that are available here.
This can lead to poverty, disadvantage and isolation.
That is why the new integration system asks newcomers and established immigrants to learn Dutch and to adopt our social rules.
Equality of all people is the most important standard.
Parents must take responsibility for their children, be involved in the school and preferably also be involved in the (sports) club.
Integration through work and neighborhood remains crucial.
The Netherlands must offer protection to a proportionate share of genuine refugees within the European context.
This can only be achieved through a clear and fair asylum procedure: fast and careful.
Individual assessment of each asylum seeker is and remains the starting point.
Admitted refugees should be given rapid opportunities to integrate into Dutch society.
Repeated asylum applications must be prevented.
Those who have been told that they will not receive a residence permit must actually leave the Netherlands.
The government should not raise false expectations.
Human smuggling and trafficking are being combated at European level.
A European approach supports the reception of refugees in their own region.
The government is there for the citizens and must therefore be of service.
Because in the end, the citizen is the boss.
Administrative responsibility is not sufficiently visible.
In the current chaos, everyone is a bit concerned but no one really is.
Then you shouldn't be surprised if people no longer know who to hold accountable.
In a democracy, power must lie where the voter has control over it.
This starts with a clear definition of public responsibilities and tasks.
The latter are not performed privately, unless on a contract basis.
Do well what you can, don't do what you can't, don't do too much.
The starting point for public administration is: regulate as much as possible close to the citizen.
The municipality is therefore given room to make its own choices wherever possible.
Cutting back on provincial tasks increases clarity.
No provincial officials for education, integration, elderly and youth care.
The province limits itself to spatial planning, traffic and the environment.
The administrative level of 'district councils' will be abolished.
It's time for the elected mayor.
The Constitution must stipulate that it is directly elected by local voters.
The efficiency and serviceability of the implementation by the national government, province and municipality must be increased.
Information and communication technology makes it possible to serve citizens much better and, for example, to request data only once and not over and over again.
It also gives the government opportunities to work significantly more efficiently.
A prerequisite for this is strict national management and the prevention of the creation of private kingdoms.
There is also still much to be done within the government to reduce the tax burden.
While maintaining quality, a quarter of the total number of internal controls must be eliminated.
Governments must stop trying to outdo each other's rules.
So no national tightening of European rules.
No provincial tightening of national rules.
No municipal tightening of national and provincial rules.
Implementing organisations adhere to a strict bureaucracy standard: a maximum of fifteen percent of costs for management and administration.
This standard should apply to all organisations that are paid for half or more from tax money or premiums, including schools and hospitals.
Let the professionals do their job!
Good health is valuable to all of us.
When you are ill, you want to be able to rely on excellent health care.
Dutch healthcare is relatively expensive in relation to the quality provided.
The financing of the health care system has just undergone major changes.
An important step forward.
But there is more.
Starting with an increase in quality and patient friendliness.
Healthcare expenditure will continue to grow under the VVD as well.
Hospitals and healthcare institutions are aligning their working methods more with the rhythm and wishes of the patient.
Greater transparency about the performance of hospitals and specialists means you know where to go.
If every patient has their own data in an 'electronic patient file', the dependency on one doctor or institution becomes smaller.
In nursing homes and home care, the need for regulation is being reduced; The home care worker is now almost too busy with forms to have a coffee chat.
In care homes that respond creatively to what the elderly want, a lot appears to be possible.
Less bureaucracy: hands at the bedside, space for professionals.
Living at home is more pleasant for many elderly people than living in a nursing home.
We need to take this into account more in housing construction.
Nursing homes should offer more variety: a purchase flat or rental apartment, depending on what people want and can afford.
The resident's privacy is respected.
The accessibility of society for people with disabilities must be increased.
In a turbulent world, our country must stand up for its interests with determination.
Furthermore, we want to actively strive for a dignified existence for all citizens of the world.
An active foreign policy requires the means to implement it.
The Netherlands must remain a reliable ally and partner within the UN, NATO and the EU.
Maintaining and strengthening the international legal order remains a priority.
The European Union and the internal market are of enormous importance to the Netherlands.
The main question is for which matters the Member States take joint responsibility.
What outcomes do we want; Where are effectiveness and recognisability guaranteed?
The institutional debate is a derivative of this.
The VVD strives for a Union in which people, goods, services and capital can move freely.
A Union that makes fewer rules and provides subsidies,
and becomes better at trade policy, energy policy and asylum policy.
The point is not to make Europe as small as possible, but as good as possible.
Enlargement of the EU, provided it follows the established rules, means that more people participate in the common market and legal order.
Ultimately, this is good for our economy and security.
The importance of the Union for the Netherlands must be highlighted by a stronger European role for the Prime Minister.
Our country already makes an important contribution to development elsewhere in the world.
Opening up the markets of rich countries to poor countries should provide new impetus to this.
The Netherlands must continue to have a modern armed force that can be deployed in difficult circumstances and far from home if necessary.
Together with like-minded countries, we must address problems as much as possible before they reach us.
Under the authority of civilian authorities, the armed forces are also carrying out more and more tasks within national borders, for example in the fight against terrorism.
We need to do more for the armed forces.
Our men and women deserve it
and the resilience of our democracy is served by it.
The government must perform well, be helpful and work efficiently.
However, the government is not a business.
The Dutch state is not a private limited company.
Citizens are not customers.
The difference?
You are either born into the state or you enter it.
In the language and between the people.
You can't do without it.
Even when you leave the country, the Netherlands is under your skin.
A citizen does not have the power of the customer, who can walk away dissatisfied.
Therefore it must be very clear that the citizen is in charge in this country.
That's what parliamentary elections are for.
But elections alone are not enough.
You are only a free citizen if the elections are about something.
That is why we present these clear choices to the voter.
