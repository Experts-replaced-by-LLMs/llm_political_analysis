**Summary of the Political Manifesto of the Party "Ataka"**

**Environment:**

- **Stance on Environmental Policies:**
  - The manifesto does not explicitly detail specific environmental policies or targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
  - There is a focus on nationalizing resources and industries, which may imply a shift towards more controlled and potentially sustainable practices, but this is not explicitly stated.
  - The construction of new nuclear power plants (two new blocks at Kozloduy NPP and a new NPP) is proposed, which suggests a reliance on nuclear energy as a part of the energy mix.
  - There is no mention of investments in renewable energy sources or specific environmental regulations.
  - The manifesto does not address the balance between environmental protection and economic growth directly.
  - There is no explicit commitment to international environmental agreements or sustainable practices.

**Key Points and Policy Positions:**

- **Economic Model:**
  - Radical shift from neoliberal market fundamentalism to strong state regulation and social justice.
  - Criticism of the European Union's economic policies and the impact on national sovereignty.
  - Emphasis on nationalizing key industries and resources, including gold mining and energy sectors.

- **Income and Social Policies:**
  - Immediate increase in minimum wage to 1000 BGN and minimum pension to 500 BGN.
  - Focus on reducing economic inequality and supporting the middle class and domestic businesses.

- **National Sovereignty:**
  - Strong nationalist rhetoric, advocating for a reevaluation of Bulgaria's membership in the EU.
  - Opposition to the current structure of the EU, comparing it to the Soviet Union.
  - Call for true nationalists to represent Bulgaria in EU structures to fight for restructuring.

- **Resource Management:**
  - Immediate termination of concessions for gold mining and energy distribution to return profits to the nation.
  - Establishment of state-controlled banks to support small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture.

- **Employment and Innovation:**
  - Creation of a state program to eliminate unemployment within six months through public projects and orders.
  - Establishment of a high-tech park and a state center for the commercialization of Bulgarian inventions and patents.

- **International Relations:**
  - Strategic reorientation of the Bulgarian economy towards China, India, Brazil, Japan, and Russia.

The manifesto emphasizes a strong nationalist and protectionist approach, with a focus on state control over key economic sectors and resources. However, it lacks detailed environmental policies and commitments to sustainable practices.
