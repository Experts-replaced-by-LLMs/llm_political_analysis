**Summary of the Political Manifesto (Language: Hungarian)**

**Decentralization:**

- **Stance on Decentralization:**
  - The manifesto emphasizes a strong pro-decentralization stance, advocating for significant legislative, fiscal, and administrative autonomy for regional and local governments.
  - The party criticizes the centralization efforts of previous governments (Fidesz and MSZP) and positions itself as a proponent of regional self-governance.
  - The manifesto highlights the need for a balance between regional autonomy and national coherence, suggesting that local governments should have more control over their resources and decision-making processes.

- **Policy Proposals:**
  - **Economic Autonomy:** The party proposes the establishment of regional banks (e.g., "The Bank of the Countryside") to support local economies and reduce dependency on central financial institutions.
  - **Agricultural and Rural Development:** Emphasizes the importance of local agricultural production and proposes policies to support local farmers and rural communities, including the protection of local land ownership and water resources.
  - **Infrastructure and Energy:** Advocates for regional control over infrastructure projects and energy resources, including the development of local renewable energy sources and water management systems.
  - **Education and Healthcare:** Proposes decentralizing the education and healthcare systems to allow local authorities to tailor services to the specific needs of their communities.

- **Federalism and Governance:**
  - The manifesto suggests a shift towards a more federalist system, where regional governments have greater legislative powers and financial independence.
  - It calls for the re-negotiation of Hungary's relationship with the European Union to allow for more regional autonomy, or alternatively, considers the possibility of exiting the EU to establish a Central European cooperative framework.
