REWARDING RESPONSIBILITY
Our prosperity and well-being are under pressure.
The sky-high wage costs and tax pressure mean that we are no longer competitive compared to our neighbouring countries.
In addition, the aging population challenges our social security.
Increasingly fewer active people have to finance the pensions and health care of an increasing number of inactive people through their social contributions and tax payments.
Without thorough reforms, our social security system is in danger of collapsing.
Despite the large budget deficits and even though Belgium was already a world leader in terms of government spending, government spending has continued to rise in recent years, from 53.3% in 2011 to 53.9% in 2014 (+0.6% GDP).
In the European Union, government spending fell by 0.5% of GDP over this period (from 49% to 48.5%).
It should come as no surprise that our economy has deteriorated in recent years.
In 2013, more than 12,300 companies went bankrupt, a sad record and an increase of 11% compared to 2012.
Unemployment has risen from 7.5% to 9.1% since 2011, the highest level in sixteen years.
Employment decreased by 11,000 jobs from 2011 to 2013.
Only the creation of tens of thousands of subsidised jobs was able to somewhat mitigate the negative trend.
The sky-high wage costs in particular are undermining our competitive position, as the evolution of the trade balance makes painfully clear.
When the euro was introduced (2002), it still had a clear surplus.
Today the trade balance shows a deficit.
We face the enormous challenge of getting our economy growing strongly again and giving more people jobs.
This can only happen if we once again encourage and reward the people who create prosperity through work and enterprise, instead of discouraging and punishing them.
They carry our welfare and prosperity state.
With taxes and social contributions they finance our health care, our care for the elderly, our care for people with disabilities and for those who end up in poverty…
It is high time to reward those who work, do business and save again.
By increasing take-home pay, by reducing corporate taxes, by cutting taxes and by reducing government spending.
1.1. REWARD WORK
In order to keep social security affordable, it is crucial that more Flemish people work longer.
With an employment rate (20-65 years) of 71.9%, Flanders performs ten to fifteen percentage points better than Wallonia (62.6%) and the Brussels Region (56.7%).
However, the ambition is higher: by 2020 we must get at least 76% of all people of working age into work.
Work is often not attractive enough.
Due to high taxes and social contributions, those who work are punished rather than rewarded.
Nowhere in Europe does someone's income so quickly reach the highest tax bracket.
The highest rate of personal income tax is also the second highest in the European Union.
The difference between income from work and benefits in the event of inactivity or unemployment is often too small to encourage people to take a job – this is the so-called inactivity trap or unemployment trap.
It is hardly worthwhile for an employer to give employees a raise.
66 to 71% of the wage increase is skimmed off or taxed away.
The employee only keeps 29 to 34% net.
This is especially discouraging for low-wage workers who want to advance.
Our social protection system makes an ever-increasing group of the population structurally dependent on benefits.
Belgium spends twice as much on passive labour market policies as the OECD average, with a comparable unemployment rate.
Belgium is also the only country in the world where unemployment benefits are unlimited in time. 250,000 unemployed people, or one in three, have been receiving benefits for more than five years.
A group of 119,000, or 17% of all unemployed people, even for more than ten years (RVA figures, 2010).
Benefit dependency is also encouraged by systems such as the waiting allowance for young school leavers and the early retirement scheme.
Recently, these systems have changed names – ‘waiting benefit’ became ‘integration benefit’ and ‘bridging pension’ became ‘unemployment with company allowance’ – but in reality they have remained largely unchanged.
Despite the rising costs of the ageing population, the federal government continues to send workers aged 52 and over into early retirement on a large scale
Labour law is outdated, there are more than a hundred different and partly overlapping labour market measures that are often unknown or inaccessible to self-employed persons, entrepreneurs or SMEs.
In 2013, there were 112,000 early retirees, 3,000 more than in 2005 when the Generation Pact was concluded, while many of these people could still be actively involved in the labour market.
The organization and functioning of our working world are not optimal.
Employers and employees do not find each other sufficiently in the labor market.
This is a task for education (see Chapter 2) and for the VDAB.
At the same time, our social legislation must be adapted.
Those who have a job often have to work hard.
Due to high labor costs, employers place high productivity demands on their employees.
The ‘lemon model’ of our labour market increases the risk of illness and disability, and leads to early retirement.
Today, the Belgian has an average career duration of only 32 years.
In our neighbouring countries, people work longer: an average of 39.6 years in the Netherlands, 37.5 years in Germany, 34.6 years in France.
The effective retirement age in Belgium is on average 59 years, six years below the statutory retirement age.
For the growing group of dual-income households, it is not easy to combine raising children and other family tasks with a job outside the home.
The law governing working hours has not been structurally changed since the 1970s.
Those who work their whole lives should have the prospect of a decent pension so that they can continue to live a decent life ‘in their old age’.
The affordability of pensions hangs like the sword of Damocles over our social security.
Apart from a few limited interventions, nothing has been achieved in recent years in the form of the major pension reform that has been announced for so long.
At cruising speed, the measures of the Di Rupo government will yield 0.3% to 0.4% of our GDP, barely one twentieth of the ageing effort that the European Commission is proposing to us.
1.1.1. Reward for work
1.1.1.1. Vision
To get or keep more people working, we need to reward those who work.
Therefore, the high taxes on labour must be reduced urgently, for both employees and employers.
By reducing the unemployment trap, and thus increasing the difference between benefits and net wages, we increase the incentive to go to work.
A reduction in social security contributions and personal income tax is most appropriate for this, because it has the greatest impact on the lowest and middle incomes and focuses on the active population.
1.1.1.2. Change for Progress
In personal income tax, we offer Flemish people a tax burden that is in line with what an employee pays in neighbouring countries.
Today, anyone who works quickly ends up in the 45% tax bracket (the second highest rate).
We will tackle this by first broadening the 40% bracket by increasing its income ceiling.
This means that the 45% bracket will disappear.
This is how work is rewarded.
In a second phase, we will raise the ceiling further, so that the highest bracket of 50% is only retained for the highest incomes.
In addition, we link the income limits of the brackets to economic growth, which means that people are less likely to be taxed in the higher bracket.
Every hour of work should pay off.
This is not only fairer, but also motivates people to get and keep working.
We are making additional efforts to reduce the burden on the lowest wages.
We are increasing the social work bonus and phasing it out more slowly, so that the lowest wages bear the lowest costs.
Those who earn a minimum wage are exempt from social security contributions but still continue to build up rights.
Today, correct remuneration is based more on the employee's competencies and less on age or seniority.
1.1.2. More people at work
1.1.2.1. Vision
A solid social security system is one that is social and secure, and to which as many people as possible contribute.
Every talent is important and necessary.
We therefore focus on what people can do rather than what they cannot do.
Those who can take responsibility should take it.
Those who can work, should work.
Working increases self-esteem and self-confidence and is the best guarantee to escape and stay out of poverty.
For some job seekers, subsidized employment in the social economy is the most appropriate option,
others can work in the regular economy with or without support,
still others would like to become self-employed.
That is why we guide job seekers to the most suitable position: to the regular labor market, to the social economy, but also to their own business.
In the social economy we focus as much as possible on transition to jobs in the regular economy.
By allowing everyone to participate, according to their own knowledge and abilities, social security is assured and the individual and his family are strengthened.
We provide better support to people who are less fortunate and help them to become self-reliant again as quickly as possible.
We provide professional care for those who remain dependent on care and cannot rely on their own network.
1.1.2.2. Change for Progress
Activating dismissal law
Today, too many employees are still left out in the cold when they are affected by redundancies.
They are sometimes even encouraged to remain inactive by, for example, early retirement or all kinds of compensation on top of their unemployment benefit.
We convert passive dismissal law into active guidance towards new work.
We do this by providing every affected employee with appropriate personal and intensive guidance from the moment the dismissal is announced, regardless of the size of the company.
Collective and individual dismissals are treated equally as much as possible.
The barriers to quickly finding a new job after a restructuring or closure has been announced must be removed.
Employees threatened with dismissal who quickly find work elsewhere, for example, should be able to enjoy the benefits of a social agreement.
Supporting, stimulating and activating the unemployed
We are reforming the mainly passive benefits policy into a real activation policy by providing intensive, tailor-made guidance to both young and older job seekers and by strengthening controls on availability for work.
In order to restore the insurance principle in unemployment, we make the duration of unemployment benefits dependent on the number of years previously worked, with a maximum of two years.
At the same time, we strengthen the activation, vocational training and labor integration of job seekers.
In the first phase of unemployment, with the stated maximum duration of two years, we provide better financial support to the unemployed through a higher replacement ratio.
This ensures that the benefit is closer to the salary the employee received when he/she was active.
In this way we significantly reduce the social and financial impact of becoming unemployed.
In the first phase, too, attention immediately goes to reactivation.
If this is not possible, he will receive a lower flat-rate activation benefit in the second phase, adapted training and guidance towards new work.
This activation allowance is limited to one year or the duration of the training.
We will phase out the integration benefit for young school leavers (waiting benefit).
Instead, we guarantee young job seekers personal support in finding a job, intensive guidance, vocational training or (temporary) work experience within four months.
At the same time, we expect them to participate positively in this process towards a new job.
We help young people who enter the labour market with insufficient qualifications to acquire the required competencies and work attitudes (such as working in a team, arriving on time, etc.) through workplace learning in a non-school context.
The activation of older job seekers, which has already been expanded in Flanders from 55 to 60 years, will be further extended to the age of 65.
We guide job seekers to the most suitable position: the regular labor market, the social economy, their own business.
For job seekers who have difficulty taking the step towards (paid) work (e.g. due to medical, psychological, psychiatric problems), we provide a combination of welfare and care guidance with preparatory steps towards work.
We actively encourage and support companies to better integrate people with disabilities into the workplace.
We ask employers to focus on what employees can do and not just on what they cannot do.
We are strengthening the comprehensive language policy for job seekers.
Because a lack of knowledge of Dutch is a major barrier to employment, we are introducing a mandatory language test for all non-Dutch speaking job seekers.
If they do not have sufficient knowledge of Dutch, we provide them with Dutch training in a guidance programme at VDAB or VDAB partners.
The Dutch course can be integrated with vocational training or in the workplace.
In order to better fill bottleneck vacancies and bottleneck professions, we offer tailor-made training to job seekers in collaboration with entrepreneurs, including training on the work floor, in company schools, etc.
In this way, we strengthen the competencies of job seekers in terms of what the labor market really needs and the outflow to work after a bottleneck training can further increase.
We are realising a further division of the VDAB into an actor and director role.
In its directorial role, the service can call on the expertise of private companies and non-profit organizations to train and guide job seekers and employees.
The services provided by VDAB must be complementary to the services provided by private companies and non-profit organisations.
Job seekers decide as much as possible for themselves which services and which organisation they call upon for guidance, mediation and training.
We involve the social partners in the management of the VDAB, but services and measures that they themselves use cannot be managed by them.
There must at all times be a clear distinction between judge and party.
The right to tailor-made guidance and unemployment benefits is offset by the obligation and responsibility of the individual job seeker to actively seek work.
The local VDAB consultant who guides the job seeker is also authorised to monitor job search behaviour.
If a job seeker does not make sufficient efforts or fails to keep agreements, for example by refusing to take a language course, the VDAB will impose a sanction. activate social assistance
When we reform unemployment insurance along foreign lines, we must at the same time modernise social assistance into an activating system rather than merely an ultimate social safety net.
We are implementing a reinforced activation policy for minimum income recipients.
We deploy the OCMW supervisors who, within the framework of Articles 60 and 61 of the OCMW legislation, guide people on social assistance to a suitable job (such as green services, cleaning or home help, handyman services, etc.) in local job shops, in collaboration with the local VDAB.
In this way we avoid duplication of work and ensure an optimal flow to regular jobs.
We link the right to social assistance to the obligation to perform community service.
Anyone who is not involved in activation full-time as a minimum income recipient or who does not immediately qualify for this must perform community service.
Our municipalities are the ideal partners to organize community service.
The starting point is that people remain maximally involved in the labor market, do not become socially isolated and do not lose their self-esteem.
We are making social assistance benefits poverty-proof and increasing them to the European poverty line, taking into account the (social) benefits granted.
A modern view of social assistance also involves a modernisation of the 'assessment of means of subsistence' as we know it in the case of the minimum income and the OCMW.
Today, the family home that is occupied is largely excluded from the assets test.
We completely exclude them.
The levers to impose sanctions or conditions on social assistance are currently spread across different governments.
It is best to bundle regulations at Flemish level, with application at local level.
Social economy
The right to work requires special attention for vulnerable groups.
For those who find it feasible, integration into the regular economic circuit is the first objective.
For those who are not or not immediately able to achieve this, there is an important role for various initiatives in the social economy.
Based on the principle that the person is central, we provide a backpack or personal wage cost premium in proportion to the loss of performance of each target group employee.
Everyone can take their support with them into the regular employment circuit.
Employees in the social economy who are able to progress to regular work must be given the opportunity to do so and seize it.
We provide financial support to social economy companies, in relation to the goals set and the progress made.
Support must benefit those who need it most, otherwise there is a risk of resources being fragmented across too large a target group.
For the sake of legal equality and transparency, we are simplifying the subsidy measures.
Social economy companies operate transparently and in line with market standards after compensation for loss of productivity through subsidies.
The Flemish minister responsible for Employment is also responsible for Social Economy.
We evaluate the decrees on Customisation and Local Service Economy in terms of the achieved throughput, the duration of the trajectories and the competence enhancement of individual employees and we make adjustments where necessary.
After the sixth state reform, Flanders will have full responsibility for Subsidised Contractual Employees (GESCO), of whom there are approximately 37,000.
We are regularising the GESCOs that currently perform regular government tasks at local authorities by transferring part of the relevant wage subsidy to the personnel budget of the (local) authority concerned.
We are switching a number of GESCOs to a temporary work experience program that is maximally focused on progression to regular jobs.
We will phase out the remaining GESCOs by not replacing current employees when they leave or retire.
In practice, the Local Employment Agency (PWA) system is often an unemployment trap for the long-term unemployed concerned.
After its transfer in the context of the sixth state reform, we will allow the PWA system to phase out and be incorporated into the existing measures.
For cleaning help for private individuals, this is possible at the service voucher companies of the relevant municipalities and OCMWs.
A modern labor market
Our labor market is too rigid.
A thorough adjustment of employment law is necessary so that companies can respond flexibly to rapidly changing economic circumstances
and employees can take charge of their own careers.
We are investigating whether the existing rules are still necessary or whether they cannot be simplified
and whether unnecessary differences have arisen between sectors or large and small companies.
We are establishing one Flemish and one federal inspection service for social and labour legislation, which will replace the current nine services.
With a unified statute for employees and civil servants, we ensure equal treatment and greater mobility between the public and private sectors.
The same social laws apply to all employees.
This makes doing business and working a lot easier.
We are taking measures to enable flexible contracts for limited performance (linked to low wage costs), including within government.
In addition, we opt for annualisation of working hours, flexible deployment of temporary workers and an expansion of the provision of employees.
We provide sufficient social protection for permanent employees as well as for temporary workers and employees with temporary and flexible contracts.
Focus not on passive, but on active migration
The Flemish labour market does not stop at borders.
Cooperation with Wallonia, Brussels, neighbouring countries and the rest of Europe is advisable.
We will of course continue to focus first on activating our own labour reserve and increasing interregional mobility with Brussels and Wallonia.
However, given the increasing tightness on our labour market, we also see international labour migration as an increasingly important final element of labour market policy.
In active economic migration, the focus is on the profile and competencies of the migrant workers, and not on the (bilateral) agreements with the countries of origin (see also Chapter 2.2).
1.1.3. Making work attractive
1.1.3.1. Vision
Not only the wages, but also the quality of work is important.
Especially if we want employees to stay at work longer and with pleasure, they must feel good in their workplace, be able to use their competencies and be able to learn (further).
To prevent employees from leaving the labour market in a rut, burned out or exhausted, we implement an attractive career policy and make it possible to work differently.
The N-VA wants to work towards a healthy combination of work and family, for various family situations, such as single parents, dual-income families with young or older children, newly formed families, etc.
A new legal framework offers employees the opportunity to solve their daily work-family-free time puzzle, and employers the flexibility to respond to a rapidly changing market.
1.1.3.2. Change for Progress
Working on a career
We want to provide maximum support to all Flemish people to take control of their own careers and shape them optimally.
We offer career support (including the career cheque) to anyone who works, is looking for work or has lost their job.
With a view to a coherent training policy, we are integrating the various instruments (training vouchers, paid educational leave, training credit, etc.) into a single instrument that enables workers to retrain or reorient themselves.
The support is tailor-made and can consist of financial support, additional leave or a combination of both.
In order to give everyone the space to develop their own career, the Flemish government allocates a training budget where the employee chooses which company or organisation he/she follows training at.
Combining work and family
Service vouchers are an important instrument for combining work and family life, especially for working Flemish people with children.
To ensure affordability, we are adjusting the system based on three objectives: combining work and family, combating undeclared work and activating low-skilled and long-term job seekers.
The price of service vouchers remains at 9 euros per hour.
We also retain tax deductibility.
After all, a further price increase would drive customers and their cleaning help back to working illegally.
We are strengthening the guidance of job seekers to the service voucher circuit and ensuring better integration and language acquisition of employees of foreign origin.
We prevent fraud at service voucher companies through strict recognition criteria and controls.
To help combine work and family, we offer employees the necessary time and space to occasionally recharge their batteries, to follow training courses, to care for young children or parents in need of care.
The rights that an employee builds up fill a backpack that he can use to temporarily work less.
We only provide a replacement income (at RVA) and an equal treatment with days worked for pension accrual for ‘motivated’ interruptions for parenthood, care or education.
We ensure the affordability of time credit and career breaks by removing the excesses.
Taking a sabbatical year or a world trip can be very enriching for yourself, your career and your environment, but social security should not pay up to 650 euros per month for this.
Young and older employees from the public and private sectors are treated equally in our proposal.
We encourage teleworking, home working and satellite offices.
We encourage companies and business parks to offer their employees a laundry, crèche or ironing service.
1.1.4. Insuring the pensions
1.1.4.1. Vision
Given the increasing life expectancy, the ageing population and the rising costs of social security, we have no other choice than to all work more and for longer periods of time and to continue working.
The thorough pension reform that has been talked about for so long must really come about in the coming years.
The pension should reward those who have worked.
The statutory pension (the first pillar) ensures solidarity across generations and remains the basis for maintaining the standard of living in old age in our pension reform.
1.1.4.1. Change for Progress
We are strengthening the viability of the first pension pillar by taking greater account of paid contributions, the evolution of the financial capacity of the active population and the evolution of life expectancy when calculating pensions.
The technique we propose is that of the backpack principle, a calculation whereby working longer and contributing more always leads to a higher pension.
The retirement age remains at 65, a full career lasts 45 years.
Anyone who is 65 years old and has contributed for 45 years is given a choice: they can enjoy a full pension or they can continue to work under the same conditions (fiscal and parafiscal) as other active workers.
In that case, he receives his pension, combines this with his supplementary salary, but does not build up any additional pension rights.
In this way we create a win-win situation in which the employee can earn additional income, while social security continues to be financed with social contributions.
Anyone who is 65 years old and has not yet contributed for 45 years can also choose to continue working.
In this way, he can build up further pension rights (up to a career of 45 years) in order to acquire a full pension.
Even those who are not yet 65 can still retire in certain cases.
However, we limit the possibility of taking early retirement to a maximum of five years, i.e. from the age of 60.
Anyone who uses this option will receive a reduction (malus) in the pension amount.
This penalty is calculated on the basis of the number of years of early retirement (as compensation for a career shorter than 45 years).
The second pillar (supplementary insurance through the employer) and third pillar (individual pension savings) form an important addition to the statutory pension and ensure a healthy mix in the build-up of the pension.
We safeguard the favorable tax treatment of supplementary insurance and pension savings.
We guarantee that the minimum pension for those who really need it will be raised to the level of the poverty line, as defined in Europe, taking into account the social benefits granted.
Strengthening the first pillar: Pensions. Taking into account the backpack principle, evolution of the carrying capacity of the active population and life expectancy Equalisation Equalisation of pension systems in the private and public sectors Minimum pension Minimum pension after a full career at the level of the European-defined poverty line Indexation Adjusted automatic indexation mechanism for social benefits (such as pensions)
We will gradually allow the various pension systems (from the private and public sectors) to converge.
Everyone builds up pension rights according to the same principles, regardless of whether he/she works as an employee, civil servant or self-employed.
Equal contributions create equal rights.
Today, a third of statutory pension rights are based on ‘equivalent periods’ for which no work performance or social contributions were made.
There is no doubt that traveling the world or taking a sabbatical can be an extremely educational and fruitful experience, but those who continue to pay contributions in the meantime should not have to pay for it.
That is why we will thoroughly weed out the proliferation of equivalent periods, such as the equivalent for the very long-term unemployed (longer than two years).
Periods of illness or interruption of career for maternity and parental leave are treated equally for pension accrual purposes.
We are phasing out early retirement.
The early retirement scheme places a huge and unsustainable burden on the shoulders of future generations and on the future of our social security.
Only early retirement from the age of 60, as described above, remains possible.
In the event of divorce, we achieve an equal division ('splitting') of pension rights between married couples and cohabiting couples.
Working longer must go hand in hand with better and different employment opportunities for older workers, such as mentoring for younger colleagues.
Specific work regimes, adapted working conditions and adjusted wage costs can make it possible to work longer at an older age.
1.2. REWARD ENTREPRENEURSHIP
According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), only 8% of adults in Belgium have set up or plan to set up a business, compared to a European average of 12%.
Worryingly, the private sector no longer seems able to create jobs.
The National Bank writes in its latest economic forecasts: ‘There will be almost no net job creation throughout 2014’.
The reasons for this are well known: our tax system discourages self-employed people and entrepreneurs instead of encouraging them.
It stunts growth instead of stimulating it.
It is complex rather than simple.
It increases costs instead of reducing them.
For example, the nominal corporate tax rate in Belgium is 33.99%, which is much higher than the average in the EU (22.8%) or the OECD (25.3%).
The effective rate is also lower in many countries.
On top of that, many competitive disadvantages weigh on our businesses and our economy.
The runaway wage costs are the main handicap.
We will discuss this in more detail later in this text (see 1.3).
The energy price places an additional burden on companies.
It is higher than in other European countries.
This is partly due to the high distribution rates, transport costs and financing of support for renewable energy.
Our cost handicaps are further exacerbated by low competitive pressure in some sectors, anti-competitive regulations and weak competition.
The quality of our research & development (R&D) can somewhat compensate for the cost competitive disadvantage.
In recent years, the Flemish Government has increased its R&D budget by 220 million euros, but the private R&D share from industry has decreased.
The scarce resources available are deployed in too fragmented a manner and the numerous initiatives and instruments have significant overlaps.
This results in poor output and valorisation.
All this means that we are sinking ever deeper on the various international competition lists, that it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract foreign investments and new establishments to Flanders and that job creation per investment is decreasing.
Today we see more and more direct investors moving to our neighbouring countries.
However, more companies mean more jobs, more people in work, more paid contributions.
That is why we need to reward people who take responsibility and work, do business, save and invest again.
1.2.1. Stimulating entrepreneurship
1.2.1.1. Vision
Anyone who starts their own business or runs a company sticks their neck out and takes responsibility.
We want to see this rewarded and supported rather than distrusted and punished.
Because entrepreneurship creates added value and employment, provides income and profit, and thus creates prosperity and well-being.
That is why we need people who are entrepreneurs.
Therefore, the government should encourage rather than discourage people who engage in entrepreneurship, and reward rather than punish them.
Entrepreneurs and self-employed people are eager for legal certainty.
They want to know where they stand – today, but especially tomorrow and the day after.
The government must give them that legal certainty.
This applies primarily to taxes.
The tax system must be stable.
Simple too.
And of course with the lowest possible rates.
It should also be better able to attract investment.
Flanders must remain an attractive location for research centres, headquarters and other important decision-making centres.
Innovation, research and development are essential to generate economic growth.
Every government euro invested in R&D creates a multiplier effect that attracts private investment in R&D.
The marketing, valorisation and commercialisation of research and innovation strengthen our economic fabric.
To grow and invest, companies need capital, either from their own resources or from external financing.
The government can support companies in this.
This can be done by encouraging the formation of equity or by facilitating access to external financing (with instruments such as the Flemish guarantee scheme and the win-win loan).
1.2.1.2. Change for Progress
Fiscal pact
We are immediately reversing various antisocial nuisance taxes: the increased liquidation bonus from 10 to 25%, the excessive '309% fines', the tax increase for 'benefits in kind', ...
We conclude a transparent 'Fiscal Pact' with the companies.
In this way, we lay down the rules of the game for a period of five years and guarantee companies a stable, legally secure and business-friendly tax system.
A break with the past.
Over the past decades, corporate taxation has been subject to annual interventions – recently even several times a year.
Today, tax authorities are increasingly required to interpret tax laws at their own discretion, and companies are treated differently depending on whether they have a different tax inspector.
Simpler, clearer, more competitive and fairer.
We need this kind of tax legislation.
With the 'Fiscal Pact' we bring the nominal corporate tax rate below the average rate of Western European countries (27.13%).
In the long term, we will further finance the reduction by, among other things, weeding out the numerous deductions.
Corporate tax can be fairer.
Some companies shift their profits across national borders, meaning they pay proportionally much less corporate tax than local SMEs.
We fully support European initiatives to ensure that every company pays taxes where it actually makes its profits.
In addition, we take maximum action against excessive debt financing of participations or profit shifting through abuse of 'transfer pricing' (these are the prices of goods, services and rights that controlled or related legal entities supply to each other).
The notional interest deduction is a well-intentioned measure, namely to promote financing with equity, but improper use undermines the original objectives.
We want to replace the notional deduction with a lower corporate tax rate and, on top of that, higher deductions for innovative companies and anchors that create jobs here.
In any case, we tailor our instruments to attract specific types of companies and international companies to developments in neighbouring countries and the rest of Europe.
We had a favorable tax policy for holding companies and headquarters for a long time.
In order to once again compete with neighbouring countries, we are increasing the current DBI exemption (the exemption for dividends on which tax has already been paid) to 100% (instead of 95%).
The Flemish Government reduced the property tax on equipment and tools.
We will continue to reduce this in the coming years.
Support financing
We encourage companies, especially SMEs, to strengthen their own equity.
That is why we partially exempt profits that remain in the company from taxes until the moment the profit is distributed.
We are developing additional instruments to stimulate co-entrepreneurship.
We make it attractive for Flemish people to participate in our companies.
In this way we strengthen access to capital, anchor companies and increase the involvement of Flemish people in entrepreneurship.
We are generalising the exemption for income from savings, so that it also applies to income from, among other things, shares and bonds.
We are increasing the exempt amount to 2,200 euros.
This is how we bring savings out of hibernation and let them find their way to companies.
Investing in Research and Development
One Flemish minister will be responsible for economy, innovation and science policy.
To increase economic growth potential, we are investing more in research and development.
We are mapping out a growth path to reach the three percent target by 2020 (3% GDP for R&D), of which one percent will come from public investment.
In the expenditure of R&D resources, we strive for a correct balance between fundamental and applied research.
The concept of innovation will be given a broader definition (in addition to product innovation, also process innovation) in order to provide more impetus to both SMEs and large companies.
We are concluding a Flemish innovation pact with the business community that stimulates investments in R&D by both the government and companies.
In research projects, in addition to a framework for fundamental research, sufficient attention must be paid to the flow to industry.
The principle of excellence is central to the financing of institutions and projects.
The results achieved are monitored.
In the policy, we make clear choices for specific sectors and (sub)themes that tie in with the strengths of Flemish industry and the priority themes of the European Horizon 2020 strategy.
We rationalise, optimise and simplify the Flemish innovation instruments and follow the recommendations from the Soete I and II reports.
With the Flemish innovation policy we are responding more to international initiatives and European research programmes.
We are lowering the threshold for companies to access Flemish research infrastructures.
They are essential for making knowledge available and anchoring it.
We provide further support to the Flemish supercomputer.
The policy supports researchers and knowledge workers.
They form the basis of an innovative economy.
A specific strategy focuses on career aspects, career attractiveness, flexible working conditions,
attracting foreign talent,
mobility between companies and knowledge institutions (such as spin-offs), coordination with and flow into the labour market (including for doctorates), multidisciplinary training and exchange of experiences with companies (such as innovation internships)
and an efficient strategy for directing young people to STEM disciplines that focus on exact sciences, applied sciences, technology and/or ICT and mathematics.
The grant application cycle is simplified and accelerated.
Companies are guided through targeted guidance and communication.
We also expect innovative action from the government and its administration.
We are finally working on an efficient system of innovative procurement.
The subsidy support is extended to cover the entire innovation process.
Specifically, the financing of pilot environments and temporary test beds and the testing of new or improved production concepts and environments is made possible.
Feasibility studies, guidance for drawing up dossiers and designing proofs of concept are also eligible for financing.
1.2.2. Entrepreneurs appreciate
1.2.2.1. Vision
Self-employed people and entrepreneurs are people who stand out from the crowd.
By taking risks, investing and doing business;
For this they deserve respect and appreciation.
Today they are confronted with a federal policy that shows contempt and disdain rather than respect and appreciation.
Here too, we need to change course and the government must signal that it values ​​entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs.
By cultivating an entrepreneurial spirit among young people.
By supporting starting entrepreneurs and self-employed people and behaving in a business-friendly manner.
By placing as little administrative burden as possible on the shoulders of self-employed persons and entrepreneurs.
1.2.2.2. Change for Progress
Instilling an entrepreneurial spirit
Our education familiarizes students with entrepreneurship and encourages them to develop a spirit of enterprise from an early age.
We are better coordinating and making existing initiatives, such as mini-enterprises, sales days and innovation camps, more coherent.
We are revising and strengthening the business management training.
A good business plan, sufficient knowledge of accounting and taxation, and the ability to manage a company commercially are essential to be successful.
A business-friendly government
It is in everyone's interest that all forms of fraud are tackled correctly and decisively.
However, inspection services must primarily act as a partner for companies, especially when a first violation has occurred.
Together they look for solutions.
The government undertakes to pay all invoices within 30 days.
We involve the business community in the development of government policy through specific round tables.
In this way, we take the needs and wishes of entrepreneurs into account as much as possible.
An SME pact will be launched with an economic strategy for SMEs and family businesses.
The pact contains measures to address bottlenecks in terms of space, mobility, permits and the coordination between education and the labour market.
A separate Flemish trade establishment policy will be introduced.
The importance of strong but liveable cores is central to this.
We are developing a modern industrial policy by optimally coordinating education, training and the labour market,
by focusing on innovation, growth sectors and growth countries
, and by reviewing government subsidies for enterprises (regrouping of resources, rationalisation and impact measurement, modern and open allocation rules).
Entrepreneurship is made more attractive for young people by giving student entrepreneurs with a specific status more opportunities to develop their entrepreneurial talent.
The Belgian law regulating working hours has not been structurally changed since the 1970s.
It is based on a completely outdated labor market.
With a new legal framework, we offer employees the flexibility to solve their daily work-family-free time puzzle, and employers the flexibility to respond to the rapidly changing market.
The Flemish Agency for International Business (Flanders Investment and Trade) will become the single point of contact for foreign trade.
Companies can go there for everything related to international business.
We are strengthening the competition authorities and bringing them together in one independent ‘Consumer and Markets Authority’ (Competition Authority, CREG, BIPT, on the one hand, VREG and VRM, on the other).
Self-employed entrepreneurs must feel protected by a sound social status.
Pregnancy, parenthood, illness, etc. must not make it impossible to operate the business or carry out the activity.
Less administrative burden
We will continue on the path towards a more efficient licensing policy.
Now that the environmental permit has been obtained, we must take a step further, including by merging the powers regarding the environment and spatial planning in terms of policy.
With far-reaching digitalisation, we are finally putting into practice the ‘ask-only-once’ principle that the government must respect.
We are expanding the Flemish government's project for generalised 'electronic invoicing' to the entire government.
1.3. AND THEREFORE REDUCING LABOR COSTS
1.3.1. Vision
Nowhere is labor taxed higher than here.
To improve the competitive position of our companies, it is crucial to reduce labor costs.
In this way we are tackling our wage cost handicap, which according to Eurostat figures amounts to an average of around 16% for the total economy, and even rises to 25% for the private market sector.
A general reduction in the burden on labour is urgent.
Only in this way can we give our entrepreneurs oxygen to do business and create jobs.
Getting more people into work will increase economic growth and make it easier to balance government finances.
In addition, the wage formation process must be reformed.
We do not believe in a centrally coordinated approach, but in a wage formation model that is built from the bottom up, with more flexibility for sectors and companies.
1.3.2. Change for Progress
We will tackle the existing wage cost handicap with a general and linear reduction in the social employer contribution for all employees.
In this way we make labour cheaper and our employees become competitive again with neighbouring countries.
In line with the recommendation of the European Commission, we are shifting the focus of the wage formation consultation to sectors and companies (as is the case in many other OECD and EU countries).
This decentralisation also offers a way out of the current malaise of the federal social consultation model in Belgium,
and can better align wage developments with productivity developments in the various sectors and companies.
In this way, we ensure an efficient approach to closing our wage gap with neighbouring countries.
At the same time, we provide an answer to the fact that the 1996 Competitiveness Act proved to be insufficiently enforceable, partly because compensation for excess was not activated.
At sector level, we work with ‘all-in agreements’ covering all wage and employment conditions.
At company level, employees and employers are given the autonomy to deviate, by mutual agreement, from wage agreements concluded at a higher level.
This model provides an important impetus to restore our competitiveness and competitiveness.
It must keep wage costs under control and provide flexibility to sectors and companies.
At the same time, it strengthens the bond between a company and its employees.
In bad times, everyone can make an effort.
In good times, employees can enjoy higher profits to a greater extent.
To ensure the purchasing power of the most vulnerable groups in our society, we provide an adapted and guaranteed indexation mechanism for all social benefits, such as pensions and unemployment benefits (see Chapter 1.5).
We opt for an annual adjustment at a fixed time.
We simplify the opaque tangle of all kinds of fragmented target group measures with various reductions and exemptions by only retaining them for specific target groups (e.g. the elderly, early school leavers) or for those who need sustainable support (people with disabilities).
The proliferation of fringe benefits is a direct consequence of the high taxes on labour.
We are replacing the tax benefit of meal and eco vouchers with a tax-free allowance (on net salary) of the same value.
In addition to significant administrative simplification, this will also mean savings for employers and retailers.
1.4. ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN PRACTICE: SOME POLICY AREAS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
The policy proposals we put forward above benefit all businesses and self-employed people.
However, various sectors are facing specific problems.
1.4.1. Hospitality spices up FlandersLekker-Land
1.4.1.1. Vision
A comprehensive and coherent plan must provide the catering industry with fresh oxygen and new opportunities.
With solid craftsmanship and excellent hospitality, thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees shape 'Vlaanderen-Lekker-Land'.
However, dark clouds have been hanging over the catering industry for years.
Without a structural reduction in the burden on labour, thousands of jobs in the hospitality industry are at risk of being lost in the coming years.
A study by KU Leuven indicates a potential loss of 12,900 to 21,000 jobs.
1.4.1.2. Change for Progress
We are giving catering establishments more options to deploy additional staff at peak times (nice weather, parties, etc.) and we are making occasional work more flexible, especially for family members who help out.
We are simplifying and making more flexible the student work system (400 hours instead of 50 days), without compromising the social protection of young people.
We are modernizing the establishment law for starting a restaurant, with incentives to follow additional training.
The introduction of the electronic cash register should be the final step in eliminating undeclared work and must therefore be accompanied by a serious structural reduction in the burden on labour and further administrative simplification.
We are extending the reduced VAT rate of 12 percent to all beverages.
We group all checks into one basic inspection that checks labor, hygiene and all documents.
An inspection is also carried out prior to the opening of a catering establishment.
1.4.2. TOURISM PUTS FLANDERS ON THE MAP
1.4.2.1. Vision
Flanders has a high-quality tourist offering that we can certainly continue to promote.
After all, tourism has not only a social but also an important economic impact.
It is one of the few growth sectors and also generates many jobs.
Jobs - also for low-skilled workers - that are locally anchored and therefore cannot be relocated.
Tourism can only grow if the tourist product is and remains attractive.
We achieve destination development by strengthening and connecting our core tourist attractions, as they generate the largest flows of visitors.
Therefore, we must simultaneously increase the competitiveness of our tourism sector and encourage entrepreneurship and employment.
We must also continue to focus on preconditions such as safety, cleanliness, accessibility, etc.
We are further developing the ‘Flanders’ quality brand and consistently applying it in our general destination promotion and to target groups.
Both neighbouring countries and international growth markets offer opportunities for this.
1.4.2.2. Change for Progress
Highlighting Flemish assets
We are developing an ambitious strategic master plan and an impulse fund for each of the three macro products: Coast, Art Cities and Green Regions.
We invest in a thematic tourism development and strengthen our product lines of cycling, walking, dining, art, heritage and fashion.
International potential, innovation, digitalisation and modernisation are the common thread.
In analogy with the cycling junction network, we are opening up the whole of Flanders with a walking junction network.
We focus more on top events with international appeal, such as exhibitions, sporting events and festivals.
We continue to invest in renovation, quality improvement, accessibility and fire safety in the youth tourism sector.
The diversity of the youth accommodation offer is guaranteed for group accommodation.
We are catching up in the field of conference tourism.
Firstly, the focus will be on investment-enhancing interventions that stimulate private investors.
We are starting the preparation for the 'Brueghel Year' (2020), following the '100 years of the Great War'.
With this commemoration we create opportunities for the gastronomy, heritage and art sectors.
Working together for better results
Tourism Flanders takes the lead in forging partnerships with both private and public actors.
The common Flanders brand must be safeguarded, strengthened, expanded and further professionalised in this regard.
We are professionalizing tourism training courses, paying special attention to workplace learning and internship facilities.
Where possible, we seek to connect with European initiatives.
The operation of the holiday participation support centre is a good example of cooperation between public and private tourism partners.
We will continue this work so that disadvantaged Flemish people can also enjoy a holiday or trip.
1.4.3. Building Change
1.4.3.1. Vision
“If things are going well in construction, things are going well everywhere” aptly illustrates the importance of the construction sector for the entire economy.
In addition to a general tax reduction to compete with foreign companies,
the sector is best served by measures that stimulate demand for new construction and renovation.
1.4.3.2. Change through Progress
Our proposals for housing policy can be found in Chapter 2.
Here we limit ourselves to a limited number of specific measures: For all renovation works, including reconstruction, we apply a reduced VAT rate of 6% everywhere.
We are developing a single, transparent support system for energy-saving measures that replaces subsidies, premiums, discounts and tax benefits.
This can be done through property tax, personal income tax or a unified subsidy system.
For social housing, we prioritize renovation and reconstruction.
We will continue to encourage the use of social loans for renovation work, reconstruction and new construction.
Legislation and controls must be there for everyone, both domestic and foreign companies.
Social exploitation must be tackled, economic loopholes closed and pointless pest controls avoided.
Foreign companies should not be allowed to operate freely and should be controlled in the same way as our own companies.
A free market means an equal chance of being caught for all market players, regardless of their origin.
1.4.4. Transport must move forward
1.4.4.1. Vision
In the European logistics hub that Flanders is, transport companies play an important role.
However, road transport, with its 60,000 direct jobs, is struggling.
The profitability is extremely low.
Since the outbreak of the crisis, more than 1,300 transporters have gone bankrupt, approximately 15% of the total number of transport companies.
Our competitive position is below par.
We are not only losing market share to Eastern European companies, but also to companies from neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands, France and Germany.
Our general vision on mobility can be read in chapter 2.3.
1.4.4.2. Change through Progress
Ensuring competitive position
It is also crucial for the transport sector that wage costs fall.
At an average Flemish transport company, wage costs amount to 40% of the total cost structure.
The rollout of alternative fuel stations deserves support.
In the meantime, professional diesel remains indispensable for the sector.
In this respect too, our excise duties must remain competitive in relation to neighbouring countries, especially as long as we are at a competitive disadvantage in other areas.
Combating fraud
The measures described to tackle fraud and exploitation in the construction sector also apply to the transport sector (see chapter 1.2.3).
The Social Laws Supervision Service, the inspection services of the Directorate-General for Social Inspection and the Inspection Service of the RSZ are further integrated.
This makes the checks more targeted and efficient.
At European level, the various national control services must work closely together.
This includes correct implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive and the Benelux Treaty on Cross-Border Cooperation in Road Transport Inspections.
This way we guarantee fair competition.
Strengthening services
The registration of vehicles requires double administration at the DIV and at customs.
A laborious process that often takes several months.
Further digitalisation of procedures, such as for the customs vignette, reduces the workload and shortens the processing time.
1.4.5. Agriculture and fisheries
1.4.5.1. Vision
Agriculture must fully commit to innovation and quality, both in products and processes.
Farms, even smaller ones, survive best by specializing or diversifying.
Professionalization makes new investments more profitable.
We also want to give farmers more income security.
This can be done by giving them a fair price for their products.
Good agreements between agricultural organisations, the distribution sector and the food industry must ensure this.
The importance of producer organisations, strengthening mutual cooperation and working with local quality labels should also not be underestimated.
Clustering and coordination of companies creates additional potential, for example in the field of energy efficiency.
As the agricultural sector is expected to have to make further environmental efforts and is being asked to become increasingly productive and of higher quality, it is all the more important to opt for sustainable agriculture.
Supporting measures must ensure that the viability of agriculture is guaranteed.
Through scientific research and innovation we can preserve our fishing fleet
and support with a view to making fishing sustainable and environmentally friendly on the one hand
and increasing the profitability of the sector on the other.
The development of a dynamic aquaculture can increase the self-sufficiency of the sector.
Of course, the operation must be sustainable and the quality of the end product must be taken into account.
1.4.5.2. Change for Progress
Correct price for good agricultural products
Good (chain) agreements between agricultural organisations, the distribution sector and the food industry enable farmers to receive a fair price for their products.
We emphasize a fair producer price with reasonable margins.
Organic farming has economic potential and contributes to the preservation of environmental and natural quality.
Further research and development (including in the field of agroecology) can optimise production processes.
Promotional campaigns by and with the sector can increase market share and thus make the sector more self-reliant and reduce support intensity in the long term.
The results of innovative research must be even more widely adopted by individual farmers so that they too can achieve efficiency gains.
The N-VA wants to continue to allow scientific research into genetically modified organisms (GMOs) under certain conditions, and in doing so puts the freedom of choice and information of farmers and consumers first.
We support existing environmental and nature measures such as erosion strips, grass strips and hedge edges in a more area-oriented manner.
At European level, the N-VA wants to evolve further towards more targeted support and a fairer distribution of these resources among our farmers.
The Common Agricultural Policy must provide sufficient flexibility to the competent authorities in the Member States to implement a tailor-made policy with attention to cost-efficiency.
We are taking initiatives to conduct more research at European level into bee mortality and the impact of crop protection products.
We pay more attention to the restoration of natural habitats in the countryside.
Sustainable fishing Fishermen, the processing industry and the distribution sector must receive a fair price for their products.
We contribute to this by continuing to inform consumers about quality products.
To preserve the marine ecosystem, we prohibit overfishing and discards and limit bycatch as much as possible.
Fishing quotas must correspond to the productivity of fish stocks.
We will continue to monitor this unabated.
The rules on overcapacity and the promotion of the use of sustainable fishing techniques apply to both the European and non-European fleet.
1.4.6. Managers run government companies, not politicians
1.4.6.1. Vision
Federal government agencies provide important services for our families and businesses.
They are among the largest employers in the country.
In doing so, they constantly run the risk of being caught between the rules of the free market and the short-term thinking of political interference.
Only by continuing to reform and innovate can public companies withstand competition from private market players.
All too often, however, carefully thought-out commercial plans for the future become the plaything of political motives.
The European Union is pushing for liberalisation of all sectors in which traditional government monopolies applied.
This operation has now been completed for a number of markets (energy and telecommunications).
In other sectors, such as postal delivery and passenger transport by rail, liberalisation is still in full development.
Some Member States, including the Netherlands and Germany, have taken the lead in passenger transport by rail and post.
In these countries, strong rail and postal companies were able to develop, which are looking for opportunities to expand across national borders.
Belgium is hopelessly lagging behind.
If we do not accelerate the current pace, we will lose out in the competition against powerful foreign companies.
The situation at NMBS in particular requires structural interventions.
When it comes to commercial activities, only a reduction in government participation can guarantee that the government will put aside its short-term interests.
Only in this way will proper business management not fall prey to political interests.
It cannot be the intention that the government should only hold stakes in commercial activities in order to earn dividends.
We are sensibly reducing government participation.
Whether or not to maintain government participation must be weighed up on the basis of two central criteria.
Firstly, universal service provision must be ensured for all citizens.
For example, public transport should not only be available in places where it is commercially viable.
In addition to legislation and subsidies, financial participation can be an instrument to ensure that service provision.
Secondly, it may be of strategic importance not to simply subject certain social provisions to the rules of the free market.
Energy distribution or water supplies are examples of such strategic sectors.
Pending the phase-out, the government guarantees the company's autonomy to determine its own lines and strategic policy.
Trade union actions at government companies often cause great inconvenience to the public.
Commuters who cannot get to work or holidaymakers who are stuck at the airport for days are not unfamiliar images.
Such strikes cause significant economic damage to private individuals and other businesses.
The right to strike is a fundamental right that cannot simply be undermined or ignored.
However, this does not mean that the right to strike may be applied without restriction.
A strike must not hold citizens and other companies hostage or prevent them from getting to work themselves.
The lack of clear strike regulations in the public sector, especially in government companies (Belgocontrol, NMBS, Infrabel, bpost, Belgacom), is a gap in the legislation that we must fill.
A minimum service provision scheme is part of this.
1.4.6.2. Change for Progress
We are phasing out government participation in commercial companies.
In this way, we will continue to work on the liberalisation of the various sectors as prescribed by the European Union.
We do this in a sensible manner in the interests of the company involved and with the greatest possible profit for the sale of the shares.
We aim to introduce strong players to the market that can develop into European market leaders.
In those sectors where universal service provision on the one hand and/or strategic considerations on the other hand require it, the government retains its financial participation, but only to the extent necessary to safeguard these two objectives.
In the meantime, the federal government will refrain from interfering in day-to-day operations and strategic considerations.
In this way, a long-term vision can take precedence over political interests.
The government, above all, refrains from making political appointments, which are the sole responsibility of the relevant board of directors.
We are completing the planned split of the railways between NMBS and Infrabel, and dissolving NMBS Holding.
We are transferring all infrastructure, including the management, maintenance and safety of the stations, to Infrabel, so that a level playing field is created for NMBS and other rail companies that will enter the market.
The government issues tenders and specifies the minimum services that must be provided, the quality requirements and the conditions that must be met regarding prices, safety and facilities.
We investigate which geographical composition of railway lines is best suited for open tenders that avoid ‘cherry picking’.
Rail companies compete for these concession agreements.
To avoid privatisation leading to high price increases for the public, public support for passenger transport will be maintained.
Foreign examples show that regionalisation of rail infrastructure can yield efficiency gains, even in small countries.
In this way, Flanders could finally exchange its paralysing waffle iron policy for a responsible investment policy.
It also allows rail policy to be directly linked to the country's own mobility policy for buses, cars and bicycles.
In this way we ensure efficiency gains and introduce accountability.
To regulate markets efficiently, effective and neutral market regulators are needed.
They must be able to function independently, with full political independence, with autonomous competition, personnel and financial policies. .
In consultation with the social partners, we determine the minimum service provision of government companies for public service tasks.
This service must be provided during trade union actions.
1.5. SOCIAL SECURITY THAT IS SOCIAL AND SECURE
Our social security system is in urgent need of change.
The current solidarity system is heading for the rocks.
We see with dismay how the financial and social support for solidarity is crumbling.
People need to see social security again as their social security and feel involved in it.
That is why we must restore the balance between the two basic principles of solidarity and insurance.
On the one hand, by activating and empowering.
On the other hand, by restoring the link between contribution and benefit.
The winners and losers of such a supportive and broadly supported social security system are known: people who work and contribute to the system will be rewarded more for this;
; people who are prepared to work but find it difficult to find work through no fault of their own or due to personal circumstances (such as mental or physical disabilities) will receive more help from the government and support in their search for a suitable job;
we tackle improper use of social security so that more people can get to work effectively;
People who abuse our social security will be punished.
If the pie is made bigger and resources no longer end up with people who don't really need them, those who do need them can be helped much better.
Our analysis, vision and proposals for change regarding unemployment and pensions have already been discussed above.
Here we focus on healthcare, people with disabilities and poverty.
Healthcare expenditure in our country is above the European average, but our healthcare system is not equally efficient in all areas.
In light of the ageing population and ever-increasing technology, which will further increase the cost of healthcare, a change is urgently needed.
According to the OECD, the fragmentation of our health policy results in high administrative and coordination costs.
However, after the sixth state reform, policy will be even more fragmented than it is today.
For example, the budget for hospitals consists of a (small) Flemish part and a (very large) federal part, which is also spread over two institutions (RIZIV and FPS Public Health).
The programming is federal, but the control and inspection are Flemish.
More than ever, the language border is a care border.
For example, 61% of Flemish people have a Global Medical File, compared to only 35% in Wallonia, and it is mainly Flemish people who register as stem cell donors (19,411 in Flanders and 4,399 in Wallonia).
The guard posts are a success in Flanders, Wallonia is lagging behind.
Flemish people go to the doctor more often, French speakers go to the hospital more often, whether or not via the emergency department
When it comes to making our healthcare more effective and preparing it for the future, the past five years have mainly been years of missed opportunities.
The federal government excelled in aimless governance: rising bills for patients, no vision, irresponsible spending and ill-considered savings.
Solutions to the overconsumption of medicines and the simplification of hospital financing have not been found.
The Flemish Government tried to contain the problems and increased the Welfare budget by almost 40%, but was unable to resolve the ongoing issue of waiting lists.
At least as important is the challenge of the ageing population that is coming our way.
This evolution creates a growing need for certain support and facilities.
Many elderly people fear that they will have to leave their homes too soon to receive the necessary care.
People with disabilities are confronted with the Belgian administrative tangle every day.
The various competent authorities and services hardly or never work together.
They each have their own definitions of 'disability' and each have their own procedures and purpose.
As a result, people with disabilities are constantly being passed from pillar to post, preventing them from fully, effectively and on an equal footing with others participating in society.
Despite the well-developed network of facilities to support and accommodate people with disabilities in Flanders, there is insufficient flexibility, meaning that the provision is not sufficiently tailored to the demands and needs.
In addition, these people are not sufficiently encouraged to contribute to society, if they wish and it is physically possible.
Flanders has made significant efforts in the fight against poverty.
Despite the economic crisis, the Flemish poverty risk rate has fallen to 9.8% (2011).
However, the battle is far from won.
The number of children born into disadvantaged families has increased over the past decade and single-parent families are more vulnerable than ever.
Many families are confronted with excessive debt, which means that the Belgian poverty risk rate is 15% (2012).
It is high time to put things in order.
1.5.1. Supporting, stimulating and activating the unemployed
A solid social security system is one to which as many people as possible contribute.
Those who can take responsibility, must take it.
Those who can work, should work.
Our proposals can be read in chapter 1.1.
To ensure the purchasing power of the most vulnerable groups in our society, we provide an adapted and guaranteed indexation mechanism for all social benefits, such as pensions and unemployment benefits.
This involves indexation being carried out at a fixed time and government price-increasing measures and the weight of energy prices being eliminated.
1.5.2. A pension that rewards work
Change is also needed in pensions.
The profound reform that has been talked about for so long can finally come about.
We also want to reward those who work and those who have worked through pensions (see chapter 1.1.4 for our proposals and 1.5.1. for the indexation mechanism).
1.5.3. Good health is the highest good
1.5.3.1. Vision
Nothing beats good health.
It is the alpha and omega of a life of happiness and well-being.
Health starts with prevention.
Prevention is more than just preventing diseases.
It also includes early detection and in many cases early intervention to prevent worse.
If care is needed, it should be provided where it is most appropriate.
Too often, people are admitted to psychiatric hospitals because there are no other options.
It is important that people with psychological problems can be treated in their familiar home environment where possible.
For the N-VA, those seeking care are central.
His needs, wishes and expectations largely determine the way in which we should structure the care provided.
That is why the N-VA opts for a health care system that uses both people and resources efficiently.
This means that healthcare providers must be able to focus on their core task: caring for patients.
We also involve patients as much as possible.
The government should strive for as much administrative simplification and computerization as possible, so that healthcare providers can focus on the patient.
Data transfer must be done electronically, with respect for patient privacy, and data collection must be relevant.
This will reduce the waiting time for patients to be reimbursed for their medicines, make test results available more quickly and avoid unnecessary tests.
Every euro we invest in healthcare must be meaningful.
This means that we must make decisions based on scientific principles.
What works has a place in our health care, what doesn't, doesn't.
This rule also guarantees patient safety.
Meaningful goes further than just effectiveness.
Meaningful also means cost-efficient and quality-enhancing.
For example, medicines will have to be used more wisely and the supply of certain services will have to be tailored to demand.
Therefore, there is a need for good planning of services and departments, linked to flexible standards and minimum activities.
1.5.3.2. Change for Progress
Help where and when needed
We will continue on the path of prevention.
Project-based activities can receive structural recognition and financing after a positive evaluation.
We aim to ensure that the resources for prevention approach the European average in the short term.
We are reducing the Flemish suicide figures, partly through sustained efforts in the areas of research and prevention.
We will allow the Flemish policy of primary health care to further evolve towards enhanced cooperation in practice at the primary care level, with the general practitioner as the central lynchpin.
Primary care providers and specialist healthcare providers will have access to the electronic Global Medical Record of each patient.
We are expanding mental health care and striving for an integrated mental health policy.
In this context, we arrange the reimbursement of the consultation with the clinical psychologist.
The elderly, the chronically ill and people with disabilities will be able to live safely at home for longer because they can make use of home care, home nursing, informal care and supporting technology for longer.
Independent living, in-home care and alternative forms of housing should be encouraged financially and/or fiscally.
There will be opportunities for adjustments to people's own homes, but also more local service centres, day care centres, more shelter options to temporarily relieve informal carers, night shelters, etc. so that these people do not end up in isolation and are less likely to have to go to a residential care centre.
This will result in greater differentiation in the provision of care according to the care needs of the elderly, chronically ill or the person with a disability.
We give easily accessible online assistance a place in the chain of care with a view to a faster and correct flow in the event of problem behavior.
We are rethinking rehabilitation from a broad and forward-looking perspective that takes into account shifts in demographics and epidemiology.
The long-term goal is a fully-fledged Flemish rehabilitation policy.
We support all initiatives to tackle pandemics in a more coordinated manner at European level.
Right to good and safe health care
We are basing our healthcare even more on the principles of Evidence Based Practice (EBP): only medical services whose benefits have been scientifically proven are eligible for reimbursement.
We eliminate anything that is superfluous or not (sufficiently) effective.
The evaluation of efficacy and cost-benefit ratio is based on independently conducted health economic studies.
In this context, we are carrying out a thorough revision of the nomenclature, based on the principle that healthcare providers who deliver quality are rewarded.
We are developing a well-functioning land registry for healthcare providers so that we can deal with any shortages in a timely manner.
Until then, we will maintain the current restriction on the number of students for medical or dental training.
The pharmacies remain in the hands of the pharmacists so that they can independently determine the drug policy of their pharmacy.
We are recognizing new health professions such as dental hygienists more quickly.
European (and other) healthcare providers practicing in Belgium must take a language test so that doctor and patient can understand each other. affordable and accessible health care
We are introducing a smart third-party payment scheme for everyone who visits their GP, so that no one has to postpone their care for financial reasons.
With this we encourage people to go to the GP first.
Conversely, we are raising the threshold to emergency and specialist services for those who register directly without a referral letter from their GP and who subsequently do not need to be admitted.
We are revaluing the compensation that doctors receive for a consultation (intellectual act) so that students are more likely to choose a profession such as general practitioner.
At the same time, more options will be available at the GP on-call service so that people no longer have to go to the hospital.
New health care services that have been proven to be effective and that are recognised can be provisionally reimbursed via an accessible supplementary Flemish (hospitalisation) insurance policy, pending effective reimbursement.
Ideally, this can even be done through compulsory insurance.
The compulsory supplementary health insurance will be abolished.
Sauna visits and other 'nice' things simply cannot be reimbursed in a responsible and affordable system.
The remuneration of healthcare providers can remain mixed and performance-oriented.
This way we avoid waiting lists or even underconsumption.
The purely performance-based remuneration will evolve more towards a system where payment is made for correct quality and service provision ('pay for quality/pay for service').
Using resources efficiently
We promote the digital registration and security of healthcare data on an individual scale and at a macro level.
Primary care providers and specialist healthcare providers (doctors, pharmacists, physiotherapists, home care nurses, etc.) can consult and supplement the electronic Global Medical File (eGMD) of each patient, according to their area of ​​competence and with a guarantee of privacy.
A unique medical file per patient will increase the quality of care
and reduce redundant research, including by digitally exchanging research results.
This will also ensure that a second opinion remains possible, without having to perform expensive examinations with advanced equipment a second time.
At the same time, this unique dossier creates digital multidisciplinarity.
We limit the administrative costs of health insurance funds to 3%.
In health insurance, the resources should go to the patient, not to the administration.
The government must have free access to all data collected by health insurance funds, among others, in the context of compulsory insurance.
This means that the federal government and the communities exchange data without any restrictions.
With a view to effectively tackling fraud in health insurance, we are merging the two inspection services of the INAMI and making them independent.
We make optimal use of the new multi-year plan for health, Horizon 2020 and the structural funds to stimulate innovation in the Flemish healthcare sector.
We support initiatives for a uniform European medicines policy.
Flemish hospitals
We are working on new hospital financing in which quality and transparency are paramount.
The remuneration will become more independent of direct public hospital financing.
Professionalised consultation between healthcare providers and management will result in a better separation between medical policy – ​​which is the responsibility of healthcare providers – and the management of healthcare (institutions).
In the context of a renewed Flemish policy and with a view to quality healthcare, we are updating the standards framework.
It must be based on scientific evidence and contribute to an efficient and correct distribution of hospital departments and services.
No judge and party
In health insurance we make a clear distinction between judge and party, between control and controlled.
It will no longer be possible for health insurance funds to draw up regulations, implement the rules and then also monitor them.
The core task of health insurance funds is to identify social needs and to defend patients.
We will have healthcare provided by the current players, alongside other (social) insurance institutions and health insurance funds – as is already possible today in the health insurance model.
A modern consultation model between healthcare providers and (social) insurers is therefore required.
This way we can reduce administrative costs, while guaranteeing quality and social services.
The health objectives, prevention objectives and quality indicators will be drawn up in consultation with all stakeholders on the basis of the real care needs of the population.
They are coordinated where possible.
All stakeholders are encouraged to actively participate in measuring the quality of care.
1.5.4. Warm elderly care
1.5.4.1. Vision
Seniors are an integral part of Flemish society.
In our society, seniors should be able to play an active role.
A patronizing approach that sees them as people who are by definition in need of help or who do not know what is good for them is at odds with this.
For the elderly who require care, we opt for a tailored range of care and services in collaboration with the seniors themselves and all organisations and institutions active in that sector.
Flanders cannot limit itself to a provision policy.
There is also a need for a quality policy that emphasizes a rich and safe 'old age' in a comfortable living environment.
In this sense, it is important to allow the elderly to feel well in their familiar home environment and to organize care in such a way that they can continue to live at home for as long as possible.
1.5.4.2. Change for Progress
In our elderly policy, we focus on home care and support for informal caregivers.
We are investigating whether it is appropriate to also introduce personal financing in elderly care.
In this way, the elderly person is free to choose where he/she wants to purchase care and how his/her needs are best met.
In any case, we will provide additional resources for home adaptations so that people can continue to live at home longer.
In terms of facilities, we focus on day care and short-stay centres and on service flats and assisted living facilities.
This reorientation is necessary to avoid the informal caregiver coming under too much pressure and dropping out completely or partially.
However, there will have to be continued investment in 'classic' nursing homes and there must be room for private initiative.
For people who no longer want or are able to stay at home, we embed the new residential care centres in the social fabric of the (local) community.
This should make it possible for today's residential care centre to become tomorrow's crèche, or for assisted living facilities in the future to become boarding homes for young families.
1.5.5. Self-reliant people with disabilities
1.5.5.1. Vision
Our vision of people with disabilities is based on autonomy and self-determination, the right to tailor-made support and care, a personal support budget and care guarantee and the right to choose support in disability-specific facilities.
The N-VA wants to organize care and support in a more demand-driven manner so that people with disabilities can decide for themselves how they want to organize their lives and what support they want and when.
For people with a (severe) mental or complex multiple disability and serious support problems, the immediate environment also acts as their representative.
These people often need protective support in a residential setting.
1.5.5.2. Change for Progress
A customer-oriented and efficient policy without administrative burden
In order to promote coordination between federal and Flemish policies, we are setting up a single medical service that uses uniform recognition criteria and issues certificates that are accepted by all authorities.
A single detailed and motivated digital administrative file from which government services can obtain data should simplify administration for persons with disabilities.
This multidisciplinary Research Service works for various government authorities and agencies and has sufficient expertise and resources to carry out a comprehensive investigation.
The Flemish Administration for Persons with Disabilities is simplifying procedures, shortening processing times and investing in high-performance databases so that it can closely monitor crucial parameters.
Its task is to efficiently match supply and demand and to enable social entrepreneurship.
Customized care
We are gradually introducing a personal support budget, without steps or levels.
The amount is determined on the basis of an individual support plan, taking into account the support needs of the person with a disability.
The aim is to be able to make informed choices to participate as much as possible in 'normal' life.
The possibilities and strengths of the person with a disability form the starting point here.
In caring for people with disabilities, one must be able to look beyond the walls of one's own facility.
That is why we are modernising the framework within which disability-specific facilities operate.
By working together with local authorities and other non-disability specific services, facilities can focus on their core task of providing quality care.
We are tackling the inactivity traps by adapting the legislative framework.
This should make it possible for those who take the step to enter the labour market to fall back on their original status if the process does not go as planned.
Given that 40% of people with disabilities currently receive benefits below the European poverty line for single people, we are modernising the system to better meet the needs of people with disabilities.
Participate fully in society
All persons with disabilities must be able to make full use of the environment, transport, information and communication and the facilities or services (culture, sport, etc.) offered to the public.
That is why we are developing regulations to set up a teleinterpretation service for the deaf, for example.
We ensure that people with disabilities and (former) chronically ill people can also obtain the best possible insurance.
They must have real access to all insurance for the most important 'life risks' under acceptable policy conditions.
People should be able to choose for themselves where they live.
That is why the Flemish Social Housing Company, in collaboration with social housing companies and municipalities, is investigating the need for adaptable/adapted housing.
To this end, a percentage of adaptable/adapted homes is provided for each cluster of new social housing at the municipal level for social housing.
1.5.6. Structurally tackling poverty
1.5.6.1. Vision
Everyone is responsible for taking charge of their own lives, but this is not equally obvious for everyone.
Sometimes life can be tough and people can be born into or end up in poverty.
Then it is the government's job to help.
To tackle poverty structurally, we follow a double track.
On the one hand, we try to prevent poverty, on the other hand, we want to accommodate and support every person in poverty as best as possible to escape poverty.
A structural poverty policy does not only combat the symptoms, but focuses primarily on the underlying causes.
This requires a tailor-made policy.
A policy that takes into account the different faces of poverty.
The N-VA therefore opts for a differentiated approach to incidental and generational poverty, urban and rural poverty, and poverty among the various risk groups.
In addition, sufficient attention must be paid to the complexity of poverty, both on the outside and on the inside.
The N-VA is convinced that the current transversal approach can work provided that good agreements are made.
Therefore there should not be one Minister for Poverty Reduction; Every minister must take initiatives within his or her policy area that take people in poverty into account and must be able to be held accountable.
Even though not everyone has a place in the regular labor market (immediately), everyone should be able to participate fully in our society.
The social economy and volunteer work promote social integration and cohesion and provide added value for those involved.
Barriers to participation must be systematically addressed with respect for the person and their capabilities.
1.5.6.2. Change for Progress
A transversal poverty policy with structural measures
We are raising minimum benefits to the European poverty line, taking into account the social benefits granted.
We also support budget management and debt mediation.
With a tailor-made activation policy based on the principles of the tailored suit, we focus on activation wherever possible.
In this context, activation goes further than simply guiding people to the regular labour market (see Chapter 1, including references to the social economy).
In the European Union we support the idea of ​​a Poverty Pact in which each (candidate) Member State undertakes to reduce the poverty rate to a maximum to be determined and can be subject to sanctions in the event of non-compliance.
In addition, the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion is the ideal forum for exchanging data and good practices.
Help should be accessible to those who need it
We significantly simplify the administrative burden and, where possible, automatically grant rights.
We will merge the Cities Fund and the Rural Fund into the Municipal Fund, with criteria and resources for combating poverty.
We assign an important role to the OCMW as an actor and director in the social integration process and poverty policy.
Experts by experience can provide added value here.
1.5.7. A child-friendly family policy
We are fully committed to a comprehensive, quantitative and qualitative family policy.
Our proposals regarding family allowances can be read in Chapter 2.1.
1.6. ACCOUNTS IN ORDER
Since 2008, we too have been confronted with the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis.
Government revenues fell, expenditures rose, budget deficits grew, debts mounted.
The European Union gave our country a clear mandate: put our house in order by cutting government spending, reducing the budget deficit and reducing the debt burden.
The Flemish Government has done its homework: for the fourth year in a row, the budget is balanced.
The federal government failed miserably.
Not even a third of the way to equilibrium has been completed.
The financing deficit fell under the Di Rupo government from 3.7% of GDP at the end of 2011 to just 2.7% in 2014 (European Commission forecast).
The deficit is therefore considerably higher than initially agreed with Europe and will increase again if policy remains unchanged.
Slightly reducing the federal budget deficit while still increasing expenditure: this was only possible by increasing revenues.
Under Di Rupo, government spending rose to 54% of GDP, a historic record.
The 23 billion euro clean-up that Di Rupo is portraying as a reality turns out to be pure fiction.
Di Rupo showed a clear lack of real savings and unlimited creativity in the search for new taxes.
CD&V and Open Vld declared that they would never join a government that would tax workers, savers and entrepreneurs.
They joined the Di Rupo government and subsequently everyone who worked, saved and did business was taxed extra.
The consequences are dramatic.
More than 30 companies go bankrupt every day.
Since Di Rupo we have counted more than 25,000 bankruptcies.
More than 400,000 people are out of work.
Since 2008, government debt has skyrocketed again.
The high debt level makes us vulnerable to tensions on the financial markets.
In addition, Belgium, through Dexia, provides guarantees amounting to more than 10% of GDP.
As a result, the remaining financial scope in the long term is very limited.
And then there is the budgetary impact of the ageing population.
Under the leadership of Minister Muyters, the Flemish Government has succeeded in restoring balance to its budget and consolidating that balance.
The ongoing turbulence on the financial markets and sluggish economic growth made this no easy task.
With the rapid and thorough restructuring, Flanders showed itself to be a good budgetary student, but unfortunately in Belgium the good student is rarely rewarded.
The federal government parties have abused the state reform to saddle the next Flemish Government with a bill of 1.8 billion euros in 2016.
A bill that will increase even further in the longer term (in 2019 this was already 2.1 billion euros).
The high bill is partly due to the fact that not all resources are being transferred to finance the new powers.
In addition, the new Financing Act severely restricts the growth of resources.
In doing so, she assumes unrealistic hypotheses about the evolution of personal income tax.
In the future, Flanders will also have to contribute more and more to pensions and may pay, but not decide.
Without all this, the Flemish budget would not only be balanced in the coming years, but there would also be room for necessary investments in our healthcare, education and infrastructure.
Now the first years of the next Flemish government term will once again be dominated by what Di Rupo did not do: cutbacks.
1.6.1. Vision
Finances are the alpha and omega of government policy at every level, from municipalities to the European Union.
The taxes, levies and contributions that a government collects determine how much it can spend on its policies.
There is a threefold ‘golden rule’ for government finances:
1. Don't spend more than you earn.
So ensure a balanced budget, so that we do not build up debts that future generations will have to pay off and we do not have to pay unnecessary interest.
2. Do not impose more taxes on citizens and businesses than is strictly necessary.
So make well-considered and thoughtful policy choices and be frugal, especially in your own operations.
3. Strictly enforce the regulations.
So do not allow some people to not pay the taxes they owe or to receive government money (benefits, subsidies, etc.) to which they are not entitled.
The N-VA wants to get its accounts in order.
In recent years, Belgium has failed to comply with its agreements with Europe.
This needs to change.
With a balanced budget we create room to implement new policies and reduce our debts.
Given the size of the government budget (54%), the N-VA wants the government to save primarily on its own resources.
The government will have to provide better services with fewer resources (see also Chapter 3).
The total tax burden has long since exceeded the pain threshold and must be reduced, because today it is those who work, do business, save or invest who invariably suffer the consequences.
The N-VA wants clear and simple tax regulations that are strictly enforced.
The simpler the rules, the less control is needed over their application, and the less tax money is lost through avoidance or evasion.
Fraud and improper use of our social and fiscal regulations harm people who do comply with the regulations correctly.
They are also harmful to our economy and to the competitiveness of our companies, as they undermine the working conditions and social protection of workers.
They also undermine support for solidarity among citizens and businesses.
The attack on solidarity and tax fraud must be tackled structurally with the same force.
1.6.2. Change for Progress
Moesennorm at the federal level
We comply with all European budgetary rules and achieve a sustainable balance in all public finances as quickly as possible, both at federal level and at that of the Communities, Regions and local authorities.
At the federal level, we temporarily apply the Moesen standard.
We are nominally blocking the total amount of government expenditure at the level of the previous year.
We compensate additional expenditure in certain policy areas (such as pensions) with savings in other policy areas.
We are primarily saving on government operating costs
. In a country with a government budget of 54% and a still rising expenditure rate, there is ample room for this.
The figures abroad prove this.
In the Netherlands, total government expenditure amounts to 51% of GDP, in Germany this is only 45%, the European average is 48.5%.
In addition to downsizing the federal government, we are controlling expenditure on social security.
We reduce expenditure on passive labor market policies by, among other things, limiting unemployment over time,
to phase out early retirement schemes and limit the equivalent periods.
In healthcare, we limit the annual growth of expenditure, taking into account demographic developments, innovation and economic strength.
We also implement socio-economic reforms that put more people into work.
This means we have to pay fewer benefits, we strengthen social security by collecting more social contributions and at the same time we ensure solidarity between generations.
Fast to Flemish equilibrium
With the sixth state reform, Open Vld, CD&V, sp.a and Groen have shifted federal deficits to Flanders.
To achieve this, the Flemish Government will have to make major cutbacks.
We are doing this in the first half of the term of office, because it is not acceptable to postpone the bill for us.
A balanced budget today gives future prospects to tomorrow's generations.
Once the balance has been restored, we will introduce a strict budgetary standard that will keep the increase in expenditure below the average growth in revenue, thus creating room to implement a stimulating socio-economic policy at Flemish level as well.
Within this budget standard we allocate 'envelopes' to the various policy areas.
Its size and growth rate are determined by the government on the basis of clear political choices.
Each competent minister must use his/her budget optimally to achieve the pre-formulated objectives and performance indicators.
Social and tax fraud unacceptable
We are making a collection policy a priority.
The fight against social fraud should not be limited to collecting figures on the checks carried out and estimating the amounts wrongly paid or not. contributions yet to be collected.
The debt must be effectively collected, both benefits and services wrongly paid to socially insured persons and unpaid contributions from employers or self-employed persons.
We are expanding the authority of the social inspection services to take precautionary measures in order to be able to respond more quickly and to limit the damage to the Treasury.
Naturally, the prohibition on self-incrimination is respected.
We are merging the various federal social inspection services into one coherent and effective social inspection service, with a number of specialised teams.
This increases the efficiency of the fight against social fraud (awareness, prevention and control) and reduces operating costs.
We make participating social security institutions (health insurance funds, unemployment benefit payment institutions, child benefit funds, holiday funds, etc.) financially responsible for combating abuse.
We support international developments in the field of taxation.
More automated information exchange and better cooperation in the assessment and collection of taxes is necessary.
A European budget that focuses on the future
With its budget, the European Union can and must help the Member States emerge from the crisis quickly and stronger.
The European budget must focus on growth, jobs and greater competitiveness (EU2020 objectives),
linked to sound macroeconomic policies (European economic governance)
and a policy that is sufficiently and under the right conditions supportive (European regional policy).
The rebates that certain countries receive because of the contribution they make in relation to their relative prosperity must disappear.
We are against European taxes.
After all, fiscal sovereignty requires sound democratic and political accountability to the citizen.
In the EU as it exists today, we opt for a contribution system, in which the European budget is financed by the Member States.
In line with the reports of the European Court of Auditors, the EU is focusing on a more results-oriented and better quality spending of its resources.
The European Parliament will have one meeting place, Brussels.
The monthly moving circus between our capital and Strasbourg, which costs a lot of money (200 million euros per year) and is anything but a model of good governance in terms of the environment, will be abolished.
STRENGTHENING SOLID MATTER
People depend on each other.
In living together with others we are fully human.
Freedom and responsibility are the foundations.
Freedom gives everyone the opportunity to develop and grow to their full potential in our society.
Responsibility requires everyone to participate in our society and to make an effort.
A society cannot survive without connectedness, involvement and cohesion.
Globalization, increasing complexity and excessive individualization are undermining the cohesion of our society.
That is why we must strengthen solidarity.
Solidarity primarily takes shape in the family, regardless of its composition.
Strong and warm families in which people take responsibility for each other and find love and mutual support form the basis of our society.
The education of children that begins in the family is continued and supplemented in education.
Together with the parents, the school passes on norms and values, knowledge and skills.
Quality education is both the breeding ground for our social fabric and a key factor in our future.
We also find connectedness and involvement in groups with which we can identify, in which we feel ‘at home’, find security and recognition.
The 6.5 million Flemish people form such a group.
Flanders is their significant community.
That is why it is important and necessary that in that community everyone is equal, has equal opportunities and then seizes them.
A cohesive Flemish community is a community to which everyone belongs, people with and without a migration background.
The 15 percent of Flemish people who were not born here or whose parents or grandparents were not born here must be given the same opportunities and rights as native Flemish people.
Naturally, the same duties and expectations apply to them, such as speaking Dutch, sharing our public culture and participating in our community.
The 6.5 million Flemish people live and work, travel and relax in a relatively limited area.
Due to increasing life expectancy and population growth, the pressure on scarce space will increase further.
In order to ensure that future generations can also settle and move freely, we now need to take an innovative approach to spatial planning, housing and mobility.
Our way of producing and consuming has a major impact on the living environment.
Sustainable development is needed in policy areas such as energy and climate control.
This way, future generations can provide for their own needs just as we can.
We must create a balance between people and the environment, between economy and ecology.
Culture, sports and the media are a binding agent that allows people to live and experience things together.
They can strengthen people individually and collectively.
They are the building blocks of our social fabric and therefore of solidarity.
Without volunteers there would be no culture and no sports.
Without volunteer work there would be no fire brigade, no Flemish Cross and Red Cross, no Natuurpunt, no youth movement and so on.
Volunteer commitment is the humus on which our community thrives.
Voluntary commitment strengthens cohesion and solidarity.
A real community is a safe community.
Only a safe community makes life in freedom and responsibility possible and gives people confidence.
It is the government's job to provide security and protection.
By organizing aid.
By combating nuisance and criminal behavior. By enforcing the regulations.
By prosecuting and punishing crimes and misdemeanors.
2.1. STRONG FAMILIES, STRONG SCHOOLS
The family is the cornerstone of our society and therefore deserves special attention.
The family in all its forms and diversity.
The time when a family consisted of a working man, a housewife and their children is behind us.
The dual-income model is increasingly becoming the norm.
Combining family and work sometimes requires great efforts from parents.
The government should support them to alleviate those efforts.
For example, the need for sufficient, affordable and accessible childcare, both pre-school and after-school, is great and calls for additional investments.
While Flanders has invested extra in family policy in recent years and created 20,500 additional places, poor pass rates among first-year students indicate that there is something wrong with the orientation and/or starting qualifications of students.
The far-reaching flexibility that makes it possible to deviate significantly from the model trajectory often means that study progress falters.
This demotivates students, places a heavy burden on teachers and the organization of higher education, and costs parents and society a lot of money.
A cohesive society is an inclusive society.
Ensuring equal opportunities and combating discrimination are daily tasks for everyone.
The government must enforce the regulations in this regard and set a good example when it comes to equal employment and promotion opportunities.
With Geert Bourgeois as Minister of Administrative Affairs, the Flemish government has made progress in recent years in employing underrepresented groups.
The federal government is lagging behind when it comes to employing immigrants; there isn't even a target figure.
For other groups, such as people with disabilities and women in management positions, neither the Flemish nor the federal targets were achieved.
2.1.1. The family as the cornerstone of our society
2.1.1.1. Vision
Choosing to have a family, in whatever form, is a personal choice with far-reaching social consequences.
The family policy safeguards this choice and pays attention to the changing family reality, with an increasing number of newly formed families, single-parent families, same-sex parents, etc.
The discrimination that still exists must disappear.
Vulnerable groups, such as children in a problematic upbringing situation and orphans, deserve special attention.
That is why the N-VA wants to work on strengthening foster care.
Families must be able to make strong choices regarding work and children.
They deserve our financial and social support.
The transfer of child benefits is an opportunity to reform and simplify the system.
Child benefits should become a right of every child.
The N-VA wants the policy to make it easier to combine work and family life and also give parents free time for relaxation and social engagement.
Service vouchers, affordable and sufficient childcare and teleworking are key concepts.
In addition to a flexible organization of the labor market, a sufficient and flexible supply of childcare is crucial.
2.1.1.2. Change for Progress
A family policy that is in line with reality
We will eliminate any existing discrimination in family policy, for example against parents of the same sex.
We strengthen foster care and give legal recognition to the rights and obligations of foster parents, including the right to be heard in decisions that affect the foster child.
We make high-tech surrogacy possible as a last resort, under strict medical and legal rules.
Surrogacy for payment remains prohibited.
Making the combination of work, family and free time feasible
We are creating additional places for childcare.
Parents of young children who work or are following a work-related training course have priority in the allocation of such funds.
We are also further expanding the range of flexible childcare options, because not every parent works from nine to five.
We ensure the affordability of childcare: a realistic rate for dual-income households and a social rate for those who really need it.
We are simplifying the rules for starting a childcare facility.
In the childcare system we give space to self-employed people.
We give childcare workers who work in an employer-employee relationship a full-fledged employee status.
We are further expanding maternity care so that women who want it can go home sooner after giving birth.
We are streamlining the conditions for adoption leave between the different systems.
Child benefit as a right for every child
Family benefits are a right of every child.
The central starting point is the position of the child and not the socio-professional situation of the parents.
All children living in Flanders who are in the same situation must be treated equally.
We are bringing the existing systems together into one system.
The same fixed amount for each child forms the basis. We eliminate the distinction in rank (first, second, third, ... child) and in age.
In addition, we provide an additional allowance for families living in poverty.
We also provide an allowance for children with disabilities, foster children and (half-)orphans.
By simplifying the system and its management, more resources are freed up for families.
Further automation of rights allocation ensures that everyone gets what they are entitled to.
2.1.2. An education that sets the bar high
2.1.2.1. Vision
Although education is not solely responsible for formation and training, and although the school should not be allowed to slide into the exclusive safety net of all educational and social problems, it is nevertheless — perhaps more than ever — a central and crucial pedagogical and social crossroads.
The government must therefore create all the preconditions for strong and high-quality education.
The N-VA explicitly chooses people, not structures.
We are once again putting students, teachers and school management at the center.
Every day, they are writing the concrete story for tomorrow on the ground, and that is why they must be given the trust and support they need.
Also from the parents by the way; Where possible they can take responsibility, where necessary they must do so.
Learning takes effort.
Education should have the ambition to get the most out of every student.
This is motivating for students and teachers.
The government must support teachers and schools in this ambition.
Children should not be victims of a misjudgment of their talent.
The bar must be raised for everyone.
Every student has the right to sufficient opportunities for growth.
Treating unequal students equally is just as unfair as treating equal students unequally.
Both abstract thinkers and practice-oriented doers deserve a good approach that is tailored to their individual capabilities and ambitions.
After their school days they should ‘know’ and ‘be able to’ do better.
Young people who enter our labour market without a diploma or qualification are particularly at high risk of long-term unemployment.
The principle also applies here: prevention is better than cure.
To prevent early school leaving and school fatigue, a preventive policy is needed in the first place.
The N-VA therefore wants to work on better orientation and adapted study choices and guidance.
2.1.2.2. Change for Progress
Guaranteed access to a quality school
To guarantee every child a place at school, we are creating additional school capacity.
We do this primarily in the cities and municipalities where demographic pressure is greatest.
We are renovating the oldest school buildings throughout Flanders.
The new or renovated school buildings are multifunctional and are available to the local community (childcare, hobby, amateur and sports clubs, local associations) and during the holiday periods for play, youth and sports field activities.
This way they can play their role in strengthening social cohesion even better.
We are simplifying the registration rules and thus giving parents more freedom in their choice of school.
Parents can only enroll their child in one school; that is why all registrations are registered centrally.
We are eliminating the remaining inequalities in financing, supervision or operating resources between the different schools.
We provide schools with more vulnerable students with additional resources to provide additional guidance to those students.
It is important that these additional resources are used in the school and in the classroom itself.
We are aligning the GOK operating resources and the financing of the boarding schools.
We award school grants automatically, taking into account the real financial capacity of the person responsible for the pupil or student's livelihood.
We take strict action against abuse to ensure that the money goes to the right families.
We encourage schools to purchase their energy (fuel oil, gas, electricity) together; This way they can save a lot of money.
Challenging every student ambitiously
We are implementing the Master Plan for the reform of secondary education in a sensible manner, in dialogue with teachers and management.
. Stronger students should be able to excel, weaker students should be able to receive extra guidance.
No broad first degree, but a solid general education including science and technology.
No postponement of study choice, but screening and updating of existing basic options.
Individual schools retain the freedom to choose their own educational project, the study programmes they offer and the way in which they organise themselves.
It is not up to the government or umbrella structures to impose one particular model.
We stimulate technical and vocational education by giving pupils a taste of science and technology in primary education and by also being ambitious in these directions.
Practical training should become a first, positive choice.
We give schools the opportunity to provide appropriate guidance to students who do not achieve the objectives, including by means of additional tests (resits) and the C certificate, without lowering the standard.
We organize student guidance and pedagogical guidance as close to and in the schools as possible.
We work together across the various networks so that we can use resources as efficiently as possible for the benefit of schools and students.
The development of orientation tests fits into the same framework.
We formulate the final objectives for secondary education as competencies and, in addition to skills and attitudes, we explicitly include knowledge.
We do this in close consultation with higher education and the labor market.
Because the group that benefits most from school often postpones enrolment in school, we are bringing forward compulsory education from six to five years.
In this way we eliminate unnecessary language and learning gaps and create equal starting opportunities for every child.
A good knowledge of Dutch is crucial for a successful (school) career.
That is why we implement initiatives to teach knowledge of Dutch (language screenings, language immersion classes and refresher lessons) and we provide the necessary encouragement to do so.
We also encourage parents to learn Dutch.
This way they can be more directly involved in their children's school careers, they can practice with their children and communicate with the school.
We combat truancy through prevention and detection as well as by making students and parents more responsible.
This can be done by providing parenting support to parents and, if necessary, reclaiming school allowances.
We use the same approach for parents who register their child late.
Teacher key figure, director game maker
With a sound career policy that takes into account the well-being of the teacher, we revalue the profession and make a position in education attractive again.
Raising the bar makes a course/career more attractive
That is why we are introducing an entrance exam for teacher training.
We provide novice teachers with guidance from experienced teachers who, as mentors, can help them absorb the practical shock between education and profession.
This way we prevent young teachers from dropping out too quickly.
We are expanding further training, introducing an educational master's degree programme and ensuring that schools provide sufficient internship places.
Teachers should be able to spend as much time as possible on teaching, not on unnecessary meetings, regulations and reports.
We are implementing the recommendations from the report ‘Stand up against planning burden’.
We are also creating a reporting point where teachers and management can report irritating regulatory pressure and which will report periodically so that follow-up is assured.
When preparing new education regulations, a test identifies the risk of irritating regulatory pressure.
Teachers have the right to effective and efficient evaluation with the aim of motivating, supporting and guiding them in the first place.
If there is really no other option, their appointment should be able to be terminated.
We create a framework for cross-school administrative support for management, mainly in primary education.
In the right place in higher education
A mandatory non-binding orientation test before moving to higher education should help students map out a study path that matches their interests and capabilities.
Students and parents thus receive information about the feasibility of choosing higher education.
To correct the excessive flexibilisation, more binding model trajectories offer beginning students a clear structure and a firm foothold.
Gradually, this system gives students more freedom to shape their own curriculum.
To encourage students to make conscious choices themselves and to monitor their study progress, we adjust the learning credit
. Under certain conditions, students can obtain a student loan from the Flemish government, which they only repay interest-free a few years after completing their studies.
Anyone who provides for the student's livelihood will continue to receive child benefit.
In addition, a student grant can be awarded based on his taxable income.
In higher education we continue to invest in research (both fundamental and applied) and development.
Universities and colleges play an important role in both building and disseminating knowledge.
Tailor-made education in the right place
We allow regular and special education to exist side by side with sufficient support.
They are complementary and each have their own objectives and expertise.
We closely monitor the results of the M-decree for students with specific needs and make adjustments where necessary.
We maintain the role of part-time arts education, with attention to a rational, geographical distribution of the offering.
We map out the lifelong learning offering and rationalize where necessary.
We make a distinction between training courses with added work value and training courses that are more in the hobby sphere.
We support what fits into a career path.
We give a financial boost to job seekers who follow a training course to increase their chances of employment.
In the context of distance learning, concepts such as ‘Open University’ and ‘MOOC’ are gaining a more prominent place.
Educational resources should be used to the maximum extent possible for education.
Too many human and financial resources are lost today due to our fragmented educational landscape.
Primary education should take place close to families.
The municipalities have a core task to fulfil in this regard.
The proposals of the 'one public network' working group can serve as a starting point to counter the fragmentation of the public network (municipal, urban and provincial education and community education).
A better connection between education and the labor market
We are developing 'learning and working' as a fully-fledged learning pathway and adapting the system to the diffuse target group.
It should focus on young people who are tired of school but not tired of learning.
We are developing a different learning path for young people in a more precarious personal situation.
In technical and vocational training courses we offer practical internships, as well as vocational training and work experience for young job seekers.
We harmonize the statutes regarding workplace learning.
For schools and internship and workplace locations, there may be only minimal administrative formalities and financial consequences.
2.1.3. Equal opportunities in an open Flanders
2.1.3.1. Vision
The N-VA stands for an open Flanders.
An equal opportunities policy is by definition a horizontal policy that must be implemented within all government entities.
We guarantee equal rights for everyone, regardless of origin, religion, belief, disability, gender or sexual orientation.
In doing so, the government may and must demand that everyone – citizens, civil society organisations, associations, employers – seizes the opportunities offered and takes joint responsibility for equal opportunities, for themselves and for others.
A government cannot and should not accept that responsibility is always placed with 'the other' or that people or groups wallow in the role of victim.
As an employer, the government has an exemplary role
. She must show that diversity works and inspire others to follow her example.
She implements a competency-based personnel policy in which 'the best woman/man in the best place' is the rule of thumb.
In this way, she develops good practical examples that can serve as inspiration for other employers, without imposing quotas on them.
2.1.3.2. Change for Progress
Exemplary function of the government
The diversity policy of the Flemish and federal governments will include more ambitious targets.
We are increasing the share of women in top and middle management to 40%.
On the advice of the SERV, we are increasing the Flemish target figure for people with a migration background to 10%.
At the federal level, we are taking a first step towards this by introducing a target figure of 5%, which should increase further in a subsequent phase.
We are achieving the target figure of 3% for employees with disabilities or occupational diseases.
We ensure that the targets are achieved by taking adequate and appropriate measures.
Horizontal equal opportunities policy
We are improving the coordination between the horizontal equal opportunities policy, the internal diversity policy and the integration policy of the Flemish government.
It is best to have one minister responsible for this, supported by the diversity officer who, as the point of contact, takes on the coordination, implementation and adjustment.
All target groups have an interest in bundled expertise and a visible policy.
We are establishing an independent Flemish Human Rights Institution.
It is responsible for the protection of human rights for community and regional powers and for combating all forms of discrimination, and will eventually replace the Interfederal Centre for Equal Opportunities.
In our society we expect everyone to accept homosexuality and transsexuality.
The public prosecutor's office and police must take tough action against perpetrators of homophobic or transphobic violence.
At the same time, indirect discrimination also deserves a strong approach.
The Interfederal Action Plan against Homophobic and Transphobic Violence must be strictly followed and adjusted where necessary.
Transgenders are still a particularly vulnerable group in society.
They must receive the necessary attention within the various policy areas.
For example, both the Minister of Equal Opportunities and the Minister of Welfare must take responsibility for continuing the Transgender Information Point.
In the pursuit of equal participation of women and men in the labour market, we are relaxing the combination of work and care (see 1.1.3.2 and 2.1.1.1).
This can contribute to greater prosperity for society as a whole.
We are stepping up efforts to make public and/or publicly accessible buildings and infrastructure accessible to everyone.
This is a basic condition for full participation in social life.
2.2. BEING FLEMISH TOGETHER
Of the approximately 6.5 million Flemish people, 15% have a migration background.
Despite the significant efforts of the Flemish government, the integration barometer is 'unfavourable'.
Not all migrants are firmly rooted here and live Flemish with the Flemish.
A lack of encounters hinders mutual understanding and is a brake on strengthening solidarity.
The employment rate of foreigners with a non-EU nationality is 39.6%, the lowest of all EU Member States (58%).
The figures in the Flemish Region are 46.3% higher than the Belgian average.
Migrants are over-represented in low-skilled jobs and are often overqualified for the work they do.
The poverty rate is almost four times higher among migrants than among non-migrants.
Their situation on the housing market is often dire.
The education indicators are also red.
Migrants and their children are more than twice as likely to have low levels of education as native Dutch people.
Even when the socio-economic position of the students is taken into account, the disadvantage of migrant children is considerably greater, including second-generation children.
These disastrous figures are largely the result of the fact that Belgium has not pursued a migration policy for decades and has opened its gates in an irresponsible manner.
Partly thanks to the N-VA, a turnaround occurred in 2010.
Important changes in the law were made during the caretaker government.
The tightening of family reunification led to a 25% decrease; the number of asylum applications fell by 36% due to changes to the Asylum and Reception Act.
Until recently, no state was as lavish as Belgium in granting its nationality.
A connection with our country was not even required.
The introduction of the fast-track Belgian law by the Verhofstadt government resulted in 558,530 new Belgians between 2000 and 2012.
That is 50 per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to an average of 11 in the entire EU.
Partly at the instigation of the N-VA, the fast-track Belgian law has been thoroughly amended and the nationality issue has once again been made migration-neutral.
Requirements regarding language skills, naturalisation and integration have been introduced.
This resulted in 90% fewer new Belgians in 2013 than in 2012.
Despite this change, our migration policy still deviates significantly from what is common in the European Union.
The inflow still consists of 88% passive migrants (family reunification, regularization, asylum) and barely 12% active migrants (labor and study migration)
. No other European country can match this.
Our asylum figures are falling, but are still well above the European average. Belgium remains almost the only country that permanently regularises illegal aliens.
The return figures are increasing, but they are still lower than in the period 2001-2006.
Readmission agreements are lacking and when initiatives are taken, the focus is on countries with which there are no significant problems.
The logic in the policy still seems to be lacking.
Today, an integrated, undocumented alien is almost twice as likely to be deported as an illegal alien who steals, deals or burglaries.
Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland sign readmission agreements with countries such as Morocco and Algeria, but Belgium has failed to do so, while illegal aliens from the Maghreb countries have been at the top of the lists for deportation for years.
And why are only 4.5% of illegal criminals released from prison removed?
This migration reality also follows from the fact that Flemish and French-speaking people have different views on asylum and migration.
For the N-VA, for example, it is obvious that when an illegal alien is regularised, the police databases are first checked.
Against this background, it is an immense task for the Flemish government to integrate the newcomers.
Minister Geert Bourgeois has already taken measures to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the integration and civic integration policy.
He brought together all sub-divisions and organisations active in the policy field in a new Integration & Civic Participation Agency and increased the capacity to accommodate the increase in the number of immigrants.
Reception agencies were given an incentive to tailor their offerings in terms of content and organisation even more to the needs of immigrants.
This is necessary due to the increase in the number of eligible immigrants, in particular Southern and Eastern Europeans.
However, the Dutch language offering for non-native speakers is still not flexible enough and does not provide sufficient answers to the substantive and organizational questions of the student.
There is a greater need for combined learning paths, for an offer during holidays, weekends and evenings, adapted to the competencies and perspectives of the student.
The waiting lists have still not been completely eliminated.
A horizontal chain approach is needed; However, the figures show that this belief is still not sufficiently established.
2.2.1. Migration that strengthens society
2.2.1.1. Vision
International research shows that in no other European country is the attitude towards migration as negative as in Belgium.
For the N-VA, migration must be a positive story.
But then the government must pursue a sensible policy and dare to make honest, clear choices.
Foreigners have rights, but they must also be made aware of their duties.
The starting point is that anyone who complies with the rules of the game is welcome.
The basic principles of a sound asylum and migration policy are clear to the N-VA: asylum policy must focus on our solidarity;
migration policy must first and foremost be aimed at strengthening our community;
a mandatory integration policy must give newcomers equal opportunities.
As long as a well-considered migration policy is not implemented, both the community as a whole and each individual newcomer will be on the losing side.
As long as our population is confirmed in its impression that everyone is welcome here and that crime is no obstacle to obtaining residence papers, every well-meaning foreigner must justify himself every day: that he is not an illegal alien, not a fraudster, not a profiteer, not a criminal, ...
That is unfair and encourages discrimination.
2.2.1.2. Change for Progress
A clear and coherent migration code
We are working on a clear and coherent migration code.
When transposing EU directives, we no longer systematically opt for the most lax interpretation.
A European coordinated asylum policy
We defend the Geneva Convention.
This means offering a safe haven to all those who have fled their country due to a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, political opinions or membership of a particular social group.
Rather than a national approach, we opt for a European coordinated policy in which each Member State takes its responsibility.
From passive to active migration
When designing our labour migration policy, the Flemish government makes full use of work permits and professional cards for self-employed persons.
The first priority is to activate those who already have the right of residence in our country.
Annually adjustable quotas then determine how many migrant workers we allow into our labour market.
We do not look at the origin of the migrant, but at his or her competencies ((highly) qualified employees).
In this regard, we are reviewing the bilateral employment agreements.
We are adapting the federal residence legislation to the new powers of the regions.
The status of researchers, highly qualified employees, etc. is no longer regulated in the Aliens Act but by decree.
The right of residence automatically follows from the right to employment granted by the regions.
In this way we achieve significant administrative simplification.
A scholarship system will be introduced for talented student migrants.
In the short term, a pilot project will be launched in which non-EU students can receive a grant, jointly financed by the government and private partners.
The project can be expanded later.
Adjust passive migration
There will be no more collective regularizations.
We will immediately stop the current policy of rewarding criminals who are in our country illegally with papers.
Anyone who commits serious violations against public order and safety can no longer be rewarded with a residence permit.
Anyone convicted of serious criminal offences within ten years will have their residence permit withdrawn and will be deported.
The new migration code with sound and correct procedures extinguishes the demand for individual regularisations.
Authorisation to stay is only possible after screening of the relevant police databases and after positive advice from the public prosecutor's office.
Like other Member States, we are putting the family reunification issue on the European table, including to set the minimum age for family reunification at 24 years.
We take measures against doctors who commit (or assist in committing) fraud in the context of a medical regularization procedure or urgent medical assistance.
Combating social security migration
Where European regulations allow it, having sufficient means of subsistence will become a residence requirement and the system of liability will be expanded and enforceable for OCMWs and other authorities.
When applying for social assistance and social integration, we examine the means of subsistence and assets, both in Belgium and in the country of origin.
The foreigner concerned must declare what property he owns in the country of origin and what other resources he has at his disposal.
Benefits paid out in error will be reclaimed.
To ensure the cooperation of countries of origin, we set up joint initiatives with other EU Member States to ensure information exchange.
The free movement of people within the European Union must not be equated with importing poverty.
This disrupts the social fabric of our cities, puts our social security under severe pressure and demotivates EU citizens who have migrated: their future prospects here are often particularly poor.
Especially when it turns out that migrants are being shamefully exploited by unscrupulous contractors, gangmasters and slum landlords.
A correct return policy
The person concerned must be given the opportunity to return voluntarily.
The Immigration Office must actively assist him in this
. An alien who ignores an initial deportation order and is subsequently arrested will be subject to forced return.
The removal of criminal illegal immigrants is the highest priority.
They must serve their prison sentences in their country of origin.
We will renegotiate take-back agreements.
Countries with high migration and low return rates and countries that make return difficult are at the top of the priority list.
In a manner that spares the local population as much as possible, we link the readmission agreements, where necessary and possible, to diplomatic pressure, trade agreements, development cooperation, etc.
A good return policy starts with a good border policy.
We make full use of the opportunity to introduce a so-called prior consultation for certain nationalities.
Diplomatic and consular Schengen posts cannot issue a Schengen visa to these foreigners without our permission.
About 20 to 30 percent of forced repatriations fail.
Following the example of France, Spain and Italy, we are introducing a scheme whereby third parties who prevent a deportation can be removed from the aircraft ready to depart and can be given a fine and, in the event of a repeat offence, a flight ban.
The fight against terrorism must be conducted more efficiently, effectively and proactively.
In addition to additional measures, the Aliens Act will be amended in the short term to tighten existing security measures and criminal sanctions.
Well-functioning settings and sound procedures
We tackle migration fraud decisively.
It becomes impossible to bet on two horses at the same time and to endlessly link and combine residence procedures.
We process every asylum application and every application for family reunification within a period of six months.
In addition, faster procedures apply in specific circumstances (e.g. labour and knowledge migration, asylum application from a safe country, etc.).
For processing a residence application (with the exception of asylum, subsidiary protection and medical regularisation) we charge an administrative fee equal to the European average (approximately 150 euros).
In principle, anyone applying for a residence permit must do so from abroad (exceptions to the rule are asylum, subsidiary protection and medical regularisation).
No nationality without integration
We no longer link the requirement for integration to the acquisition of nationality, but place it at an earlier stage of the right of residence.
There will be a tiered system of residence permits.
The first permit is valid for a specific period.
A permanent residence permit can only be granted after proven integration and sufficient knowledge of Dutch.
In the event of serious breaches of public order and security, the Minister of Justice may revoke the nationality of a foreigner who became Belgian after birth or who has dual nationality (e.g. Syria fighters).
We also provide a sound appeals procedure.
2.2.2. Civic integration and integration that offer opportunities
2.2.2.1. Vision
Integration, naturalisation and language skills are the keys to success for every newcomer and for the entire community.
We invite all newcomers to join our community and play their full role.
We do not ask newcomers to reveal their identity or give up their faith at the border.
We do ask them to share our public culture, learn our language and respect and observe the basic rules of our society.
Respect for the identity of every person, regardless of origin, religion, skin color, gender and sexual orientation, is crucial.
After all, it is these core values ​​that define citizenship and offer every Flemish person the same opportunities.
Together we must transform segregation into greater integration.
Anyone who makes an effort to learn our language and to find their way in our society should be given every opportunity and should not be discriminated against because of their skin colour or origin.
Only in this way can a society be dynamic and enriching instead of static and closed.
Only in this way can we strengthen social cohesion and solidarity.
Integration programs and language lessons remain a necessary supervised step.
We want to reach even more newcomers with an integration and NT2 (Dutch as a second language) offering that is even more tailored to their needs.
And we want to get them up and running as quickly as possible.
After all, work remains the broadest and smoothest route to real integration and participation.
Local authorities are priority partners when it comes to integration.
Living together takes place in the neighbourhood, in the district, in a municipality and in a city.
The local government level is best placed to identify bottlenecks, set priorities and help achieve an inclusive approach.
A Flanders in which the gap between 'new' and 'old' Flemish people makes way for a society in which we are Flemish together, with Dutch as our common language, remains the goal.
Our different origins are a fact, our shared future is as well.
2.2.2.2. Change for Progress
Reaching more newcomers with integration
Living together takes place in the neighbourhood, in the district, in a municipality and in a city.
This allows them to participate in education, the labor market and society.
The group of non-compulsory immigrants (migrants from EU countries) is increasing.
They also benefit from information about our society and knowledge of our language.
That is why we are taking initiatives to introduce a mandatory participation scheme in the European Union for EU nationals who settle in a Member State other than their country of origin for more than three months.
In order to better reach EU citizens, we are better aligning the integration programme with the needs of migrant workers and employers (e.g. through flexible programmes and cooperation with employers).
We are also making integration compulsory in Brussels.
A cooperation agreement with the Common Community Commission (GGC) and the French-speaking COCOF should enable both communities to offer their own programme.
In anticipation of this, we will make newcomers who have settled in Brussels or Wallonia and move to Flanders within five years subject to an integration requirement.
We encourage volunteer work as part of integration.
It is a means to participate in society, to learn our language faster and to gain work experience.
A horizontal integration policy as a structural follow-up to civic integration
Because there are limits to what an integration policy can achieve and to ensure that integration does not come to a standstill after integration, we are realising more intensive cooperation and mutual coordination with other policy areas.
With the support of the Agency for Integration and Civic Participation, we are taking concrete initiatives for a horizontal integration policy.
Points of attention include: removing barriers to the labor market and utilizing all talents;
finding suitable housing and the liveability of social housing areas;
the cultural patterns in care needs and use and the language barriers to welfare and health facilities;
youth care for migrant youth of non-Western origin;
lowering compulsory education to 5 years and language screenings, language immersion classes and refresher lessons to increase knowledge of Dutch;
involving newcomers in local community life.
The major cities of Antwerp and Ghent will continue to receive support to implement the Flemish integration and civic integration policy on their territory.
Better knowledge and use of Dutch
Because we do not want people to remain dependent on their family or an interpreter for the rest of their lives, we encourage the learning and use of Dutch in as many ways as possible.
Especially when someone receives government support or uses government services (for example, social housing).
We tailor the NT2 offering to the needs of students, including by providing combined and flexible learning paths, and offering courses during holidays, weekends and evenings.
We ensure optimal geographical distribution.
You don't learn to swim on dry land.
We encourage integrated programs in which someone also learns Dutch at work or in the training environment.
Anyone who enters a job or training course for which a basic level of Dutch is sufficient will be given the opportunity to grow further.
On the train, in the shop, on the street, in a club,…: you can practice Dutch anywhere.
We call on all Flemish people to show respect for those who are learning Dutch by giving them the opportunity to practice.
Learning a new language takes time.
Where a language gap prevents optimal service provision, we ensure that social interpreting and translation can provide a temporary solution.
An integration pact to achieve tangible results
To make integration a collective success story, everyone must participate, including employers' and employees' organisations, education partners and representatives of people with a migration background.
Together we agree on concrete objectives, which we anchor in an ambitious and comprehensive integration pact.
We monitor the results closely and periodically.
We adjust or eliminate anything that doesn't work.
2.2.3. A special case: the Flemish periphery
“The split of B-H-V has changed nothing on the ground,” admitted a notorious CD&V politician from Zaventem.
We all requested this split in order to see the language border confirmed once and for all.
Anyone who comes to live in Flanders must integrate.
But the substantial package of additional privileges that the French-speaking population was granted in the Butterfly Agreement further reinforces the impression that the Flemish periphery is le très grand Bruxelles.
The 19 Flemish peripheral municipalities continue to internationalise. 27% of the population has a foreign origin.
On top of that there is the continuing French-speaking immigration.
Consequences: an extremely expensive housing market, young people and families who can no longer live in their own region, an increasingly less Dutch-speaking and less green environment, a shortage of space and a lot of language deficiency in education, many unemployed people who do not speak Dutch...
2.2.3.1. Vision
The Flemish periphery is becoming alienated.
Many Flemish people feel less and less at home in their own street, neighbourhood or village.
The social fabric is short on cornstarch, a binding agent.
A policy for the Flemish periphery must therefore focus on two pillars.
First of all, ensure that newcomers integrate as much as possible and, if necessary, compulsorily.
They have to adapt to their new living environment.
Not the other way around.
In addition, we also need to ensure that the local community remains strong enough if we want to integrate people and immerse them in our culture.
You can only immerse yourself if there is enough water in the bath.
A second pillar must therefore offer young people and families maximum opportunities to continue living in their own region.
2.2.3.2. Change for Progress
A hospitable local reception policy for newcomers from other languages ​​must be accompanied by a resolute integration policy.
Following the negative judgment of the Constitutional Court on aspects of the 'living in your own region' decree, we are issuing new policy measures for a priority scheme on the housing market for residents with ties to the municipality.
We are significantly raising the income ceilings for eligibility for social housing and we are improving the quality of the supply, so that young dual-income families are also eligible for affordable housing in their own region.
The Flemish Land Agency (VLM) and the Agency for Nature and Forests (ANB) are realising the additional acquisition of 925 hectares of accessible green space.
We will develop the newly created Gordelfestival into a sporting family event with a message: for a Flemish and green periphery.
Cultural and tourist aspects are also taken into account.
We convert the results of the first language barometer into policy conclusions with the necessary resources.
We are once again implementing a strengthened policy for the Flemish periphery, aimed at the current 19 municipalities.
In the Rand, education focuses extra on the integration of children from other language backgrounds through language immersion years and on need-based capacity with priority for residents from the Flemish Region.
The current criterion of 'distance between home and school' should be limited to the regional border to avoid classes being flooded from Brussels and Wallonia.
A majority of the unemployed in Halle-Vilvoorde have a home language other than Dutch.
Many do not know our language well enough to be eligible for a job, while there are tens of thousands of vacancies in the region.
Yet some people still refuse to take a (free) Dutch course.
In such a case, unemployment benefits must be suspended.
As in childcare, we will continue to impose knowledge of Dutch for the recognition and support of services by the Flemish government.
We support companies in the roll-out of programmes within the framework of Dutch in the workplace.
We are tackling the major backlog in terms of welfare and health provision through initiatives such as Zorginvest (analogous to Vlabinvest).
We continue to resolutely support the strategic projects in the six facility municipalities.
We implement the flanking measures that accompany the Flemish Strategic Area Brussels (VSGB).
2.3. LIVING TOGETHER AND PROGRESSING
Space in Flanders is scarce and finite.
The demand for space (for living, working, moving around, relaxing, etc.) is high and will only increase due to increasing life expectancy and population growth.
This will be particularly noticeable in and around the cities.
Flanders has issued a great many regulations over time.
This causes additional administrative burdens and gives rise to legal disputes and procedural battles.
In recent years, Minister Philippe Muyters has addressed many sore points and worked on simplification.
For example, the rules for exemption from planning permission for minor works were simplified and the reporting obligation was introduced.
This resulted in significant administrative relief.
The introduction of the environmental permit will further streamline permit applications.
This will give us greater certainty, which will encourage investments.
Despite progress, Flanders still has a lot of work to do.
Flanders is known for its high percentage of homeowners: more than 70% of the population owns their own home.
In order to continue to guarantee property acquisition, a sufficient housing supply is necessary.
The demand for innovative housing typologies will also increase.
Social housing policy faces major challenges.
By focusing on new construction, the Flemish Government has not yet paid sufficient attention to urgent renovation needs in the social housing sector.
In addition, waiting lists continue to grow and not all social housing is occupied by the people who need it most.
In the mobility story we encounter a paralyzing standstill.
Safe road infrastructure, for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, is not available everywhere and road traffic legislation is hopelessly complex.
De Lijn's supply model does not consistently translate into a larger transport share.
De Lijn scores insufficiently in terms of punctuality, frequency, flow and comfort.
Adjusting lines, frequencies and rates to suit new target groups is a very difficult process, hampered by an overly stringent legal framework (basic mobility decision), lack of freedom in setting rates (no increase except for index) and insufficient cooperation with road authorities.
With its waffle iron policy and 60/40 distribution key, the NMBS is again postponing necessary investments in Flanders, such as the development of the ports.
The adjustment of train services is not communicated to the Flemish government in a timely manner, which has special implications for De Lijn.
Our Flemish ports are still too much competitors instead of partners, for example in terms of container traffic.
There is still much room for improvement in the port infrastructure and hinterland connections.
There is also a lack of a correct policy for the aviation sector, which increasingly encourages unfair competition between Walloon regional airports and the national airport.
The Walloon government provides significant financial support to its regional airports so that they can apply dumping rates.
Due to a lack of a structured personnel policy and failing financial management, Belgocontrol is in dire straits.
This means that Belgium has the highest unit price for air traffic control in Europe after Spain.
2.3.1. Spatial Planning: Room for Progress
2.3.1.1. Vision
Flanders is a densely populated region.
The pressure on space is great.
Integrating residential areas, industrial zones, ports and airports, roads and waterways, agricultural and natural areas requires quite a balancing act.
We must make well-considered strategic choices.
The societal challenges we face make it clear that spatial policy needs a new strategic framework for spatial planning.
Building on the Flanders Spatial Structure Plan, we are formulating new long-term objectives.
In this way we indicate in which direction spatial policy will evolve.
We need to achieve smart use of space.
We can no longer tackle open space at the same pace.
On the contrary, we will have to continue to invest in multiple use of the available space.
We will also have to build more optimized and denser without losing sight of quality and supply.
The N-VA has set three priorities: a quality housing supply, sufficient space for businesses, and safeguarding valuable open space.
With sensible densification and optimal use of the available residential areas, population growth can be accommodated in the coming years.
We make use of the wide range of housing options and continue to focus on reversing the urban exodus.
Attention to urban quality, public space and greenery in the city, sufficient supply of schools and care institutions is necessary.
Flanders must also offer sufficient space for starters, for innovation and creativity.
We can integrate space for work into the living environment and separate it where necessary for the living environment or safety.
By activating abandoned or less optimally developed areas and improving their accessibility, sufficient land remains available for further economic activities.
We integrate additional industrial estates well into the environment and make them easily accessible.
We ensure that business transport takes place as much as possible via waterways, railways and pipelines; this keeps freight traffic off our busy roads.
We preserve valuable open space through nature development and landscape management
, and by consciously choosing a liveable countryside with sufficient space for agriculture.
The N-VA invests in a pleasant living environment in cities and villages.
The N-VA considers the typical small scale of Flanders, the collection of small and medium-sized towns and municipalities, recognisable and diverse, as an asset.
We are further developing the multi-polar character of Flanders.
Instead of simply labelling urban areas as growth areas, the N-VA wants to look for centres that are easily accessible and can continue to grow qualitatively.
We must implement plans effectively.
The N-VA is convinced that much can be achieved with fewer rules, without sacrificing quality or legal certainty.
New regulations must be realistic and clear.
The starting points are: to have the applicant go through as few procedures as possible, to implement spatial policy at the most appropriate level, preferably involving only two levels of government, and to guarantee the democratic reflex (public inquiry, consultation procedures, etc.) in the most useful and efficient way.
All government departments must become aware of the spatial impact of their policies.
2.3.1.2. Change for Progress
One-stop shop for permits
We are incorporating existing permits, such as the socio-economic permit, the road permit and the nature permit, into the environmental permit.
This means that citizens or companies only need to go to one counter and can contact the various authorities involved.
To increase the efficiency of spatial planning policy, we are combining the powers of spatial planning and the environment with one minister.
We will continue our digitalization efforts unabated.
After the rollout of the digital building application, other permits and geographical information must also be available digitally.
Multiple use of space with clear priorities
Optimizing and building more densely does not mean that everything has to be built and paved.
Sensible densification is possible on spacious lots in subdivisions, where detached villas are often too large and no longer adapted to contemporary standards of insulation and living quality.
Linked and stacked buildings are encouraged, and gardens and green spaces are preserved as much as possible.
We also help families to rethink their living environment.
Where possible, we extend this principle to SMEs.
We maintain good communication with the various actors for open space so that we can focus more and better on broadening activities.
In this way, with proper consultation, recreational and cultural activities can take place perfectly on the same site where efforts are being made for nature conservation.
We further support regional activities in the field of spatial policy, so that municipalities can strengthen each other and coordinate local regulations.
2.3.2. A home for everyone
2.3.2.1. Vision
The N-VA continues to prioritise property acquisition.
Owning a home or apartment is the best investment young people can make.
It is an insurance against poverty and an insurance for the future.
Housing must therefore remain affordable.
A healthy real estate market includes a strong rental market.
We must strengthen these by better protecting landlords against rent arrears, non-payment or damage and by offering less affluent families sufficient support in finding housing.
The temporary acquisition of social housing should be better regulated and monitored so that the limited supply of social housing primarily benefits the neediest target group.
Where necessary, we will continue to invest in additional social rental housing and modest homes for starters.
The quality of our housing must improve.
Therefore, in addition to renovation, reconstruction should also be more strongly encouraged.
Renovation of the current stock and reconstruction also have priority for social housing.
2.3.2.2.Change for Progress
In addition to the measures for construction and renovation that can support the construction sector (see chapter 1.4.3), we also mention the following proposed changes: Stimulating property acquisition
We maintain the principle of the housing bonus for both existing and new loans.
Everyone is free to choose for which purchases of a single property they wish to claim the housing bonus.
In this way, the budget is used effectively to assist people in property investment.
We also retain the portability of registration fees.
However, we are abolishing the option of continuing refinancing in the home building savings scheme when a loan is re-borrowed.
We maintain the system of social loans and guaranteed housing insurance.
We are reviewing the conditions and ensuring that social loans are only granted to people who need that extra push to proceed with property acquisition.
Ensuring an accessible rental market
We are tackling the vacancy of buildings.
Social housing companies and social rental agencies can purchase and renovate vacant properties and then make them available as social rental housing.
We offer private developers the opportunity to include social housing in their projects; the government intervenes in the loss of revenue.
We make social housing available through temporary contracts to people who meet the registration and admission criteria.
We test income limits more quickly,
We will more strictly monitor the language readiness and integration requirements by improving cooperation with reception agencies and Houses of Dutch.
In addition, we usually add a work willingness requirement.
We are also thoroughly amending the framework decision on social housing
. When calculating the rental price of social housing, we take into account the energy performance, age and, if applicable, location of the home.
We allow the rental price to partly evolve with income.
If a maximum is exceeded, the tenant can enter the private rental market for the same rent price.
We tackle rent arrears and non-payment more quickly to protect both tenants and landlords against eviction and loss of income respectively.
The RWO inspection takes a stricter approach to intentional damage to a rental property.
Improving the quality and diversity of housing
We promote and facilitate innovative housing typologies such as starter, kangaroo, lancelot homes, co-housing, etc.
We encourage the repurposing of depreciated factory buildings and office buildings, for example for apartments or healthcare institutions.
By actively involving the housing and immovable heritage administrations in collaboration, we opt for broadening the support base by means of: an active repurposing policy.
2.3.3. Move smoothly and safely
2.3.3.1. Vision
Poor mobility is not only a source of annoyance.
It also hampers economic growth and social cohesion.
The core objective of the mobility policy is the best possible flow for all traffic based on the multimodality principle.
Capacity, flow and safety for all modes of transport are the key to greater quality of life.
We are getting road transport moving again by focusing on optimising the infrastructure.
But also by limiting the use of the road as much as possible by making the other modes safer and more attractive.
We are getting road transport moving again by focusing on optimising the infrastructure.
For passenger transport, this means public transport, taxis and bicycles.
Public transport can make a significant contribution to untangling the mobility knot.
It is important to invest in the right means of transport at the right place.
The government creates the preconditions so that other players can take over the operation of public transport.
The contractor must be given clear instructions, including with regard to the tariff structure and the quality of the service.
This translates into efficient and safe service provision.
Good public transport does not have to be free, it must be attractive.
We ask all travellers to make a fair contribution, while maintaining a social rate for those who are struggling.
Where regular bus lines are not efficient enough, good accessibility of demand-responsive transport systems is required.
To this end, taxis, as a fully-fledged part of public transport, must be made more widely available in rural areas.
Freight transport must be optimally distributed across road, rail and water.
Where road transport is the most appropriate solution, it must run smoothly via clear and safe routes.
Transfer points to rail or inland waterway must be easily accessible, well distributed and cheap.
In order to position the Flemish seaports more strongly in Europe, closer strategic cooperation is needed, linked to the further development of our hinterland connections.
Our airports must have a level playing field with each other, so that competitiveness between them is guaranteed.
In order to increase efficiency and performance, the regions must be given a say and financial responsibility in Belgocontrol.
Road safety is an absolute priority for the N-VA.
The aim is to evolve towards a traffic system that is as victim-free as possible.
We opt for a greener tax system, including with regard to road tax, without this leading to a tax increase.
2.3.3.2. Change for Progress
Every means of transport has its place
We are strengthening our position and role as Europe's logistics hub.
We ensure a robust and sustainable (public) transport network.
This starts with responsible investment planning in which all modes of transport complement and reinforce each other into a coherent and strong network.
After far too long of a standstill, we will no longer tolerate any delays in the integral implementation of the master plan that should get mobility in and around Antwerp moving again.
We also urgently need to improve mobility around Brussels.
We will continue to green traffic taxation.
Depending on the results of the pilot projects that are underway, we want to evolve towards a system of smart kilometre charging for passenger and freight transport.
The aim should be to better manage road use through pricing based on time, place and environmental impact.
In this way, foreign road users will also contribute to the maintenance of our road infrastructure.
Its introduction should not lead to a general increase in taxes.
Under the smart kilometer charge, companies receive a kilometer budget based on the number of employees, so that active distribution of mobility can yield benefits.
We support the construction of fully automated urban distribution centres from which environmentally friendly transports distribute goods during less busy hours.
In the meantime, we are making the annual road tax greener by calculating it based on the environmental parameters of the car.
The Flemish will be able to reduce their own taxes by choosing an environmentally friendly car.
As with the BIV reform, we will ensure that the total revenue from road taxes does not increase.
We allow ecocombis – longer and heavier trucks – into traffic, based on the findings of the pilot project and the experiences of our neighbouring countries.
At European level we are taking the initiative to make this possible.
We invest in high-quality cycling infrastructure and encourage the use of (electric) bicycles, both in the city and in the countryside.
For example, we invest in fast and safe cycle connections between residential and work areas, also for longer distances.
New gateways are needed for the ports of Ghent and Zeebrugge.
For SHIP in Zeebrugge we are looking for an alternative location for the tidal dock and lock, so that the expensive underground crossing for road traffic and tram is not necessary.
We are accelerating the construction of the additional lock in Terneuzen.
We are restructuring Belgocontrol on the basis of a balanced master plan.
The Regions and the federal government are concluding a new cooperation agreement in which the regional airports also take financial responsibility for the services that Belgocontrol provides them.
As a stepping stone to FABEC (Functional Airspace Block Europe Central, together with Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland), we organize air traffic control at Benelux level within FAB Benelux.
This results in cost savings and ensures fair compensation for the services provided.
An attractive and affordable public transport
For the management of De Lijn we opt for a cost-efficient and integrated service provision.
We are bringing the cost recovery ratio to an internationally comparable level.
For the sake of cost-efficiency in rail policy, we entrust the provision of rail services to private transport companies through concessions that also enable universal service provision.
The quality and safety on the railways are the responsibility of an independent body, separate from the NMBS, namely the Railway Safety and Interoperability Service.
We invest in suburban networks (GEN) on the railway lines around Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent.
We are optimising rail access to our ports and the rail network to and from the Flemish Diamond (Antwerp, Ghent, Brussels, Leuven).
We are also improving international train traffic and access to the Flemish Diamond, for example from Limburg and West Flanders.
We also ensure that Infrabel charges a fair fee for the use of the rail infrastructure.
The federal states will have a decisive vote in the investment policy of the NMBS.
For high-quality public transport, we are introducing tariff differentiation, based on distance or region.
We make maximum use of the new payment system (MOBIB/RETIBO).
We equip transfer points, according to size, with facilities to ensure that any waiting time is not wasted time.
A transparent and responsible traffic policy
We are introducing the driving licence with points as a management instrument for safer traffic.
We enable local authorities to implement a well-considered slow road policy.
From a positive approach to slow roads, a clear status and protection of slow roads are essential.
We create a right of requisition for civil servants in vital positions for the functioning of the traffic system (traffic controllers, pilots, bridge and lock keepers) in compliance with the European Social Charter.
We are merging the various inland waterway managers into one entity to increase the efficiency of investments in water infrastructure.
We support extensive standardisation at European level of rail networks, homologation of rail vehicles and toll collection.
We are creating a framework in which Zaventem airport can function with an equal distribution of costs but with respect for the environment.
The Brussels government's anti-bullying policy is being put to an end.
We are developing the liveability policy around Zaventem airport to create greater support for the airport.
It also includes optimising departure and arrival routes and conducting a social cost-benefit analysis of night flights.
2.4. SUSTAINABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENT
The pressure on our living environment is constantly increasing due to demographic and economic growth.
We must not allow future generations to suffer as a result.
To give our children and grandchildren the same opportunities and quality of life, we must make efforts to achieve a realistic, affordable and sustainable energy mix and limit the impact of pollution and overconsumption on our environment.
Especially for our climate, we must strengthen the efforts we are making today on a global scale.
Due to a lack of long-term vision on energy, the necessary investments in electricity production are not being made.
However, we note that energy demand is only increasing due to growing digitalization and mechanization.
Together with high government levies and taxes, this standstill policy is causing energy bills to spiral out of control.
That weighs on our families' budgets
and puts our companies at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to foreign companies.
The sixth state reform gives Flanders yet another piece of the puzzle with the distribution network tariffs.
The first thing the next Flemish Government will have to do is develop a vision on climate and energy that is effective and cost-efficient.
The nuclear phase-out is an example of federal non-policy that does not take into account the impact on security of supply and the climate.
Without any alternative, 54% of our electricity production will close in the coming years.
This is also bad for the environment, because due to the current limited potential of renewable energy, we will initially have no choice but to use more fossil fuels, resulting in unwanted additional CO2 emissions.
Our living environment is also being affected in the short term.
The soil is affected by erosion, loss of organic matter and pollution.
Air pollution caused by particulate matter and ozone increases the risk of health problems.
Noise pollution still causes too many problems.
It is five to twelve for our biodiversity.
Both plant and animal species are becoming extinct at a rapid rate.
In recent years, the number of complaints about animal welfare violations has increased.
Due to the limited number of inspectors and the poor organisation of the competent services, there is insufficient control.
With the sixth state reform, animal welfare is a Flemish responsibility and Flanders can finally put an end to violations.
2.4.1. A realistic and sustainable view on energy
2.4.1.1. Vision
Three basic principles colour the energy policy that the N-VA wants to implement: affordability, security of supply and sustainability.
Energy bills must be affordable, for both families and businesses.
The N-VA gives priority to the sensible use of energy.
Not only does more efficient use of energy reduce our bills, it also means we can secure our energy supply for a little longer.
Finally, the cheapest and greenest kWh is the one that does not have to be produced.
By opting for a realistic energy mix, the N-VA wants to guarantee that the lights will not go out.
The road to a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy mix is ​​feasible if we plan it correctly.
Renewable energy certainly plays an important role in this, but according to current plans, our energy mix will still consist of 87% non-renewable sources in 2020.
Moving away from nuclear energy without a fully-fledged sustainable alternative is therefore a step backwards.
The N-VA is in favour of phasing out nuclear power as soon as possible and by 2065 at the latest, so that we do not have to rely solely on fossil fuels as an alternative.
2.4.1.2. Change for Progress
An affordable energy bill
By analogy with the wage standard, we are introducing an enforceable energy standard.
We compare our energy prices with those in neighbouring countries; if necessary, the government must intervene with structural measures.
We make the energy bill transparent.
All costs that are not strictly related to grid management, such as the so-called public service obligations, are included in a 'social energy contribution' section, with separate components for regional and federal levies and taxes.
Any new public service obligation must be compensated by adjusting or abolishing an existing obligation.
We oppose the establishment of a purchasing centre that would resell energy from traditional power stations to suppliers, because that would be yet another stopgap measure and would be contrary to the free market principle.
We are taking measures to keep the energy-intensive industry competitive, for example by structurally compensating indirect emission costs following the German example.
We calculate the nuclear interest in an objective and permanent manner, and we make it dependent on the stock market prices for electricity
. We distribute these resources between the Regions based on energy consumption.
For example, the resources could be spent on innovation and research.
We are introducing a degressive support measure for offshore wind energy, which is linked to technological development and the electricity price.
Energy efficiency, the first step forward
We are investing in an ambitious energy efficiency pact with industry and SMEs through increased support for, among other things, investments in heating networks and residual heat recovery.
By 2030, we will reduce energy consumption in buildings by around 25%.
The government also takes its responsibility here by setting a good example.
We are also developing a single, coherent support system for energy-saving measures.
By thoroughly evaluating all public service obligations, we make social energy policy more effective and efficient.
People in energy poverty benefit more from a structural reduction in their energy bill through energy-saving investments such as roof insulation, high-efficiency glass or a high-efficiency boiler than from 100 kWh of free electricity that is quickly used up by energy guzzlers and poor insulation.
We are merging the three energy funds that support different target groups (Energy Fund, Social Heating Fund and Fund for the reduction of global energy costs) into one fund.
We mainly use the available resources to finance energy-saving measures so that the energy bill is structurally reduced.
A realistic energy mix
We are aiming for a more sustainable energy mix with less impact on the environment.
There is insufficient potential in Flanders for investments in shale gas extraction.
We are fully committed to scientific research into new and clean technology.
We are in favor of the nuclear phase-out, but against the nuclear phase-out as it currently stands.
We simply cannot afford the current scenario at the moment.
The choice for a realistic and broadly supported energy story outlines a scenario for the nuclear phase-out as soon as possible and by 2065 at the latest.
In this way, we guarantee security of supply, nuclear safety and affordable prices, and we take climate challenges into account.
We are therefore extending the lifespan of the three oldest nuclear power plants once until 2025.
As a transition to the nuclear phase-out, plans must be ready by 2015 for the construction of a new nuclear power plant using the best available and safest technologies, such as thorium.
This new transition plant will be significantly safer than the existing one and will generate less waste.
The extension of the lifespan of the oldest power stations and the construction of a new transitional power station provide sufficient breathing space to further expand our renewable energy market; We also invest in back-up capacity in the form of gas-fired power stations.
The Belgian Nuclear Research Centre is commissioned to focus on research into new technologies, including for the treatment of radioactive waste.
We are directing renewable energy resources more towards green heat and the use of residual heat.
We are orienting research and development more towards competitive green technologies such as geothermal energy, residual heat and energy storage.
We continue to build a fully liberalised energy market with a stable investment climate.
We are abolishing the complicated, opaque and unpredictable certificate market and replacing it with a secure package of support for promising green energy.
We purchase green energy certificates directly through the Flemish Energy Fund.
We are focusing more on cooperation within Europe to develop renewable energy.
In concrete terms, we work together with our neighbouring countries to further develop offshore energy production.
We are giving the grid infrastructure for the transit and supply of energy a thorough overhaul.
Where necessary, capacity will be increased.
We connect our electricity grid directly to the German and British grids.
We are implementing the offshore power socket in order to bundle the cabling from the various wind farms and bring the power to land.
We strive for a clear European vision on energy policy, taking into account the geopolitical consequences.
After all, the strategic choices of Russia, the Middle East or the United States also have an impact on the European context.
2.4.2. Respect for the climate and our living environment
2.4.2.1. Vision
As humans and as a community, we bear responsibility for the earth we live on and the environment in which we live.
Our children and grandchildren should also be able to live on healthy soil, breathe clean air and drink pure water.
Because prevention is better than cure, we primarily aim to develop technologies that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
We develop the technologies internally in Flanders as a priority.
We extend the prevention principle to waste policy.
The N-VA sees many opportunities for our Flemish companies in the materials cycle.
Not only does collecting and recycling put less strain on the environment than extracting new raw materials, it also reduces our dependence on foreign countries.
The 'polluter pays' principle can provide guidance in this regard.
Green taxation and better product standards can further reduce air pollution.
In addition, the N-VA wants to focus more on adaptation to climate change (e.g. reinforced coastal defense, better water infiltration)
Conservation objectives are important tools to maintain and enhance biodiversity.
At the same time, efforts should be made to efficiently combat invasive exotic species that cause ecological and economic damage.
2.4.2.2. Change for Progress
Greater climate efforts
We support the increase of the European CO2 reduction target from 20% to 30% within the framework of an international agreement in which all countries bear responsibility.
We continue to focus on an ambitious and binding energy efficiency target.
Since the Regions are responsible for the climate objectives, we will allow the proceeds from the emissions trading system to flow back in full to the Regions.
We aim for a reform of European climate and energy policy that focuses on technological development and a greater contribution of industry to European GDP through sustainable growth.
Remediating polluted soil
In any case, we will maintain the current pace of soil remediation.
The (scarce) resources will primarily go to land with potential for redevelopment and with the greatest impact on local residents.
We are further expanding the scope of the brownfield covenant.
To avoid expensive earthmoving, we prefer to remediate using plants and bacteria.
Better air, less noise
We invest more in green zones as collectors of fine dust.
More than ever before, we are encouraging the construction of green roofs in new construction and renovation projects.
We implement an effective noise policy in which we tailor noise standards to the environment.
Therefore, one cannot expect an agricultural company to operate completely silently.
We also invest more in noise-reducing infrastructure (e.g. adapted road surfaces, noise barriers, etc.) and quieter means of transport.
With a green tax reform we can shift the tax burden from labor to pollution and environmental impact.
Germany and Denmark in particular set a good example in this regard.
A more efficient water policy
We are accelerating the permit procedure for urgent water works, without compromising consultation.
We combine the management of non-navigable waterways within one hydrographic basin as much as possible.
Where possible, we also do this for navigable waterways.
We are introducing a compensation obligation for new paving in the form of natural infiltration zones and greenery to avoid additional paving.
We make maximum reuse of abandoned buildings and sites.
By creating green areas and green roofs, and with other small landscape elements, we avoid hardening and mitigate the heat island effect.
Flanders must work on further developing and improving the sewer network and water purification.
Separate drainage and disconnection of rainwater relieves the burden on the environment.
The principle of ‘retention – storage – delayed discharge’ for rainwater serves as a guideline.
Additional measures are needed to reduce the inflow of nitrates, phosphates and other harmful nutrients into our waterways.
In close consultation with the agricultural sector, we are further reducing the negative impact of our fertilization.
The coastal defence is being tackled with a view to the future, with attention to the natural functioning of the water and the surrounding natural walls (coastal defence master plan; the Flemish Bays project may offer the best solution in this regard and is therefore being studied in depth).
Waste is also a raw material
We are increasing the percentage of collected and recycled plastic and investing in new cost-efficient recycling and collection techniques to further purify residual waste fractions.
We are gradually reducing waste incineration capacity and stopping cross-subsidisation of waste incineration via green energy certificates.
We combat the illegal export of waste materials through targeted checks.
We are drawing up an action programme for the accelerated and affordable removal of asbestos.
In government tenders, we attach great importance to the use of sustainable, preferably recycled, materials.
We focus research and innovation on sustainable materials management and ecodesign.
We tackle food waste with targeted action plans.
Nature and biodiversity as the cornerstone of a healthy society
We will fully implement European and international biodiversity agreements and ensure a significant improvement in the conservation of our special protection areas by 2020.
We give priority to feasible, effective nature measures that create win-win situations for various sectors (housing, nature, tourism, industry, agriculture, heritage, etc.).
We do not confine biodiversity within demarcated nature zones, but we also carry out actions outside these zones, such as in residential and agricultural areas.
The government continues to invest in nature.
Owners of natural and forest lands are encouraged and supported to preserve, expand and open them up to the maximum extent possible.
Where this is not possible, we purchase valuable forest and nature areas.
We are working more on natural floodplains and on nature and water in and around cities.
We are giving the Forest Compensation Fund more clout.
We are taking the initiative to better protect the historic coastal polder grasslands.
We realize the effective protection and maintenance of 8,000 – 10,000 ha of polder grassland with ditches or microrelief.
We strictly enforce hunting conditions and use a targeted approach to combat the illegal release of game.
In the context of wildlife management, it cannot be the intention to completely eradicate native animal species.
There will be targeted checks on animal welfare violations.
To avoid unnecessary suffering of animals as much as possible, we prohibit slaughter and castration without stunning.
2.5. EXPERIENCE TOGETHER
In a real community there is time and space for shared experiences.
Time and space to experience culture and sports with others.
This benefits personal well-being and strengthens social cohesion.
Flanders boasts a rich culture, an intensive sports life and flourishing tourism.
Here too, it is the government's task to provide well-considered support for free initiatives.
Cultural policy lacks a clear vision for the future.
Many believe that the government is still handing out subsidies without guaranteeing qualitative added value for the community.
International ambitions are also ignored.
In addition to the further development, implementation and/or evaluation of initiatives that have been initiated (including the new Arts Decree, the VIAA, the cultural cooperation agreement with the French Community and the internal state reform with new administrative tasks), the precarious budgetary context in particular will be an important policy-determining factor for the coming term of office.
The crucial question is how we deal with our own cultural identity, creation and legacy in an increasingly global cultural landscape.
Technological evolution, and digitalisation in particular, has a major impact here, especially in the arts.
Never before has global distribution, discovery, exchange, collaboration and influence been easier.
Although culture and scientific research are community powers, several cultural and scientific institutions are still federal.
The three federal cultural centres (Bozar, La Monnaie and the National Orchestra) are now working better thanks to their autonomous management structure.
At the federal museums, the collections are gradually being lost due to a lack of vision and management (Royal Museums of Fine Arts, the Royal Museums of Coast and History, the Museum of Natural Sciences and the Royal Museum for Central Africa).
They languish in high attics and damp cellars, and are rarely or never put on display.
The federal government still hasn't even fully inventoried them.
The media have their own specific challenges.
Major foreign players such as Netflix, Fox, RTL, Apple and Google are putting pressure on Flemish TV production.
Foreign programmes are cheaper and can therefore more easily generate profits for the broadcasters.
In recent years, the media sector has tried to respond to this internationalisation and increasing competition with a number of concentration movements.
It was a lifeline for some media products, but it could lead to a reduction in the range of products on offer.
The sports sector will have to further professionalise in order to further stimulate the sports mentality in Flanders.
Today, there continues to be a shortage of financially strong organizations in various areas.
We must use our expertise in anti-doping policy as a calling card abroad.
Culture and sport are two domains in which associations and volunteers are mainly active.
These and the many other associations are an unprecedented asset for Flanders and for our sense of community.
Without the efforts of thousands of volunteers, they would not exist.
Just over a fifth of Flemish adults do volunteer work, in the broad association life but also in the provision of aid (hospital visits, Flemish and Red Cross, fire brigade, etc.).
The efforts of those many thousands of volunteers are not sufficiently supported.
There is no coordinated policy vision for volunteering that permeates every policy area.
The protection of volunteers is fragmented, resulting in various inequalities.
The administrative hassle and regulations hinder associations.
Increasing bureaucracy is putting a brake on volunteer work.
The protection of volunteers is arranged in too fragmented a manner.
Austerity measures are putting increasing pressure.
2.5.1. Culture and media that enrich individuals and communities
2.5.1.1. Vision
Culture contributes to individual enrichment by confronting us with unusual or unknown experiences, emotions, perspectives, observations, visions, sounds, images, opinions, ... and in this way challenging us intellectually.
Culture also contributes to community building and cohesion by actively and passively bringing people together and connecting them through shared experiences, commitments and passions.
The 6.5 million Flemish people share the same language and culture, both basic building blocks of Flemish society.
By preserving and unlocking our cultural heritage, future generations can gain insight into our cultural legacy and the path we have taken as a community.
It helps us to critically understand our place in Europe and the world.
The N-VA wants to deliberately invest in creation and supply that are culturally and socially relevant and that would not be realised or accessible to the general public without the use of tax money.
Cultural policy supplements or corrects the private market supply, based on predetermined policy priorities and quality criteria
. This is neither optional nor populist.
For the N-VA, the qualitative added value is decisive.
Being artistically active or having a so-called historical disadvantage are therefore not sufficient to obtain an unconditional right to (additional) government support.
Nor should the taste of the masses be the determining factor in subsidy decisions.
When making choices, politicians must seek advice from experts with demonstrable expertise, although these do not necessarily have to be only professionals.
The procedure must guarantee a balanced judgment and exclude any hint of 'we know each other'.
The N-VA wants a sustainable, field-oriented, transparent and motivated cultural policy.
The government invests primarily in the people in the field and only in supporting or overarching structures when they create significant and demonstrable added value for that field.
The policy makes no secret of its choices and dares to openly defend them.
In arts sectors with significant market forces, such as musicals or art trade, the government must avoid distorting competition.
Generic business support measures are only acceptable to the N-VA if they recover the maximum amount of government resources deployed.
The government encourages the cultural sector to operate economically in all facets.
However, generating one's own income has its limits, especially in economically difficult times, and many cultural initiatives cannot be self-supporting.
That is why the N-VA does not want to force the cultural sector to work purely commercially, because this would undeniably lead to a qualitative impoverishment of the supply.
Maximising audience reach, with special attention to population groups that are difficult to mobilise, also remains an important objective.
The N-VA believes it is obvious that the government should link the award of financial support to the requirement that the subsidised cultural initiative is not only potentially open to the general public, but that efforts are also actually made to reach and involve as many people as possible.
And one may be judged on the effort one has or has not made.
Of course, not every initiative has to be a public success and it should remain possible to take artistic risks.
Expectations regarding participation logically depend on the uniqueness of an initiative and the reach of the initiator.
Thus, a large subsidized institution has a proportionally more important responsibility regarding participation than a smaller one.
It is not the intention that every population group participates equally in every cultural event – ​​it is unrealistic to expect that the audience reached will be a perfect reflection of society anyway – but such proportionality should potentially be possible.
Therefore, a subsidised initiator must avoid or remove barriers, especially financial barriers, where necessary with government assistance.
However, we find that substantive motives are at least as important for not participating.
Cultural education and guidance clearly play a crucial role in this, but so does the way in which the public is approached.
The N-VA expects that an accessible and innovative approach will be used to convince new generations of culture users without losing sight of the older ones.
Specifically in arts policy, the same concern translates for the N-VA into a balanced attention for the revival of tradition and for contemporary art and for the experimental.
Flemish culture and arts policy is essentially internationally oriented.
Flanders does not close itself off, but rather stimulates international ambition and consciously positions itself in an international perspective and with international standards.
For the N-VA, this openness is linked to attention for its own language, heritage and culture as a foundation, in particular for the broad Dutch-speaking language and literature community.
The N-VA cultural policy makes room for cultural spearheads: talent development, cultural education, cultural entrepreneurship, new forms of financing, and the positioning of Flemish top talent abroad
In the media landscape, this vision translates into a Flemish public broadcaster that offers a strong guarantee for its own creative programmes and encourages private broadcasters to invest in Flemish productions.
The public broadcaster must maintain its broad remit.
At the same time, it must respect pluralism in its programmes.
The N-VA also attaches great importance to a multi-coloured private media landscape that is given sufficient opportunities.
The Flemish media sector must be able to operate within an open, clear and stable statutory framework.
This is to preserve the current diversity in the Flemish media landscape and to give Flemish private media companies the opportunity to continue to invest, develop new products and thus strengthen their position.
2.5.1.2. Change for Progress
Added value for the entire community
When assigning tasks and assessing the supporting structures (umbrellas, federations, support centres), we place greater emphasis on the mission, the added value and the desired effect on the ground and the added value ultimately achieved.
The target group is more strongly involved and valued.
For the associations, movements and open training institutions of socio-cultural adult education, we are implementing, after consultation, a new scheme that should enable multi-year financed organisations to work more flexibly, and that makes their mission for education, training and learning networks explicit.
and which pays special attention to organisations that work with disadvantaged groups in an emancipatory way and can thus fulfil a bridging function.
We are tightening the requirement of 'sufficient support and relevance at Flemish level'.
‘Management approach’ and ‘overhead cost control’ also become assessment criteria.
Entrepreneurship in the cultural sector assumes that institutions focus on professional, substantive and social developments, based on their own vision and strategy.
This means that cultural organisations are also aware of their social responsibility, their environment and how they relate to the community.
We emphasise the importance of part-time arts education as a creative breeding ground and invest in more collaboration between professional arts, amateur arts and part-time arts education.
We do this with a view to stimulating participation and mutual creative inspiration.
We take sustainable initiatives to promote reading, including in participation and poverty policy and local cultural policy.
Flanders is a culturally rich and diverse community.
There are Flemish people of the most diverse kinds.
Culture makes an important contribution to social cohesion by shaping the cultural identity of population groups and stimulating participation.
More attention should therefore be paid to the cultural experience of specific groups.
Collaboration between commercial partners, artists, education, etc. can play a role in this.
We focus on a broad cultural spectrum and invest in a mature, uncomplicated cultural policy that looks ahead and at the same time deals respectfully with its rich past.
The policy must revalue traditional, popular culture.
These cultural expressions are not second-rate culture, but represent an irreplaceable capital of values.
But traditions without evolution become folklore.
Therefore, there must be coherence between traditional and modern practice, between the amateur and the professional arts.
Middle Gate Geel '13 was a good example of this.
That is why we guarantee the necessary support for the ANZ digitalization project.
Concentration movements in the media landscape can lead to a limitation of the supply.
Ideally, the Communities should be given the powers to deal with competition.
In the meantime, we are investigating how the Flemish government can limit the negative consequences of concentration movements.
We will maintain the decoupling of Ketnet and Canvas; We will evaluate the implementation of OP12 at the latest at the end of the current management agreement.
If the added value is not sufficiently demonstrated, we can mainly fill the third channel after 8 p.m. with events.
The public broadcaster is further increasing its efforts in subtitling, audio description and sign language to ensure accessibility for the deaf, hard of hearing, blind and partially sighted.
The new 2016 radio frequency plan aims to ensure a diverse and economically viable radio landscape.
Our neighbouring countries are taking steps towards digital radio via DAB+ technology.
We must ensure that Flanders does not miss this boat.
Provide sensible support where necessary
The ratio of 'investment vs. ‘reaching audience’ is increasingly under pressure.
That is why we implement a selective subsidy policy that is based on content, social relevance, results and business quality, that guarantees more certainty and that does not hinder future growth.
for this reason, local authorities are also encouraged to enter into more high-quality and cost-efficient cross-municipal cultural cooperation.
We evaluate the operation of CultuurInvest (PMV) and Flanders DC in order to optimally tap into alternative sources of financing and to stimulate cooperation between the business community and the cultural sector.
We also organize a helpdesk for 'additional financing' and realize the exchange of knowledge and experience and win-win situations between entrepreneurs and culture, following the example of 'Culture-Entrepreneurship' in the Netherlands.
Higher education must deploy its resources for culture and arts-related research in a more field-oriented manner and in closer cooperation and coordination with the sector.
We are setting up a mobilising Flemish cultural fund, following the example of the Dutch Prince Bernard Cultural Fund, which works in a recruiting manner and which, with the help of fiscal stimuli, collects private resources from individuals and companies through donations, legacies, patronage, etc.
We are making the federal cultural and scientific institutions independent, whereby joint management by Flanders and Wallonia in collaboration with private partners and civil society ensures greater support and an international character.
Through four major clusters – PuntKunst (art museums), PuntDoc (library, archive), PuntCultuur (cultural centres) and PuntNatuur (nature museums, KMI, Observatory, etc.) – we realise real experience museums where interaction using new technologies is central.
In order to maintain an overview and gain more international recognition, we are compiling a Mercator inventory of all our own collection items.
These institutions urgently require a new model for the future, based on responsibility by both states, management autonomy and good management.
This is to ensure that our rich heritage also plays an international role.
The Royal Library and the National Archives are also still within the federal straitjacket and require shared responsibilities.
Other federal scientific institutions, as well as scientific research, can be transferred to the universities.
The public broadcaster must exercise restraint in its approach to the advertising market.
Ad-free is not realistic, but the ceilings remain in place.
We are introducing a regulated book price, so that a maximum discount ceiling applies to the sale of new books during the first six months.
International growth opportunities
We firmly place arts policy in an international context.
Flanders is a small cultural area and our Flemish artistic creation and production must therefore have the ambition to go international.
This requires a stimulating subsidy policy, but also makes 'international potential' as a standard more decisive for subsidy awards.
We subsidize relevant presentation venues, organizations and publications that should confront the public with what is happening outside Flanders in the arts scene and with established and new Flemish talent.
We strengthen the major arts institutions of the Flemish Community as top artistic ambassadors who help put Flanders on the international map.
They must be leaders in quality and management and offer talent development opportunities.
For example, we are investing in infrastructure in the renovation and expansion of the Flemish Opera in Ghent and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp.
In the context of strengthening broader cultural cooperation with the Netherlands and Suriname, we are seizing the momentum that the Netherlands and Flanders are joint host countries for the Frankfurt Book Fair 2016 to also strengthen the cultural partnership with the Netherlands at the policy level.
The joint Flemish-Dutch House de Buren must focus more on introducing and guiding international visitors to the language and the broad Flemish-Dutch cultural landscape (including via digital channels).
Collaboration with the Flemish cultural centres and in particular with the physical neighbour Muntpunt, the Flemish communication and information point in Brussels, is an obvious choice here.
The government as a valuable partner
We optimize policy coordination and cluster the following broad cultural powers with one minister: culture, youth, media, heritage and artistic education.
In order to support the field efficiently and practically, the administration takes measures for optimal information flow, the elimination of unnecessary or inefficient formalities, digitalization, helpdesk functions and customer focus.
The government should not only support art and culture financially, but also with people and materials: through better training and education for staff,
creating a clear framework and using existing infrastructure and facilities in a multidisciplinary manner.
In cultural policy, the qualitative development of photography has so far been of very little significance.
We opt for the following initiatives, based on tradition and innovation, such as the development of a representative Flanders Photo Archive.
We are increasing the budget for museums and essential heritage collections.
Collaboration with recognised heritage institutions guarantees optimal qualitative and participatory access.
For the digitalisation of heritage, we are developing a long-term approach following the example of VIAA for audiovisual heritage, but without this resulting in a new institution.
The non-fiction charter and the restrictions imposed by the Flemish Media Regulator (VRM) are insufficient to provide an answer to all ethical questions.
That is why we are looking for a solution together with the broadcasters.
One option is to establish a single general ombudsman service.
To combat fiscal and social abuse, we are legally purifying the status of the artist and increasing social control.
If we don't do this, the system will collapse under the financial burden and the artists will be the victims.
We are extending the 25-day rule for casual employees in the socio-cultural and sports sectors (exemption from social security contributions for services of a maximum of 25 working days per person and per calendar year) to the arts sector.
We express occasional performance in hours instead of days.
Investing in heritage
The care and preservation of our immovable heritage for future generations is a social duty and an investment in the tourist appeal of our region.
Heritage determines the identity and recognisability of our villages, cities and regions and contributes to a high-quality living environment.
That is why we prefer repurposing and creative use of heritage over vacancy and decay.
We want to better preserve and make our heritage accessible, following the example of the National Trust in the United Kingdom.
The Flemish heritage federation Herita and the Flemish Heritage Vault are important players in this respect for the promotion of and investments in heritage respectively.
We proactively initiate protection files and review old protection decisions in the light of clear heritage values ​​and management objectives.
We are tackling the restoration waiting list in a structural manner and eliminating the backlog.
We encourage local authorities to work together on integrated heritage care.
Minister Bourgeois' new immovable heritage decree is being implemented.
This will allow archaeological research into major investment projects to be completed more quickly and efficiently, and local authorities will be given greater autonomous responsibility for heritage care.
2.5.2. Sport that unites society
2.5.2.1. Vision
Sport contributes to health, both physically and mentally, and strengthens group feeling and solidarity.
The N-VA therefore wants everyone in their neighbourhood to be able to enjoy sports throughout their lives in a high-quality, healthy and affordable way.
This can be achieved by structurally strengthening club operations or by investing in differently organised sports.
Exercise is healthy, no matter which sport discipline.
We want to invest preventively in healthy and, above all, fair sports.
We will continue to combat fraud and doping, but prevention is always better than cure.
With a results-oriented and efficient top-level sports policy, we provide optimal support to those who deserve it and we make maximum use of existing talent.
Talent must be detected, identified and developed in a well-founded manner.
Targeted investments are needed in high-quality and sufficient sports infrastructure, for both top-level and recreational sports.
2.5.2.2. Change for Progress
Expansion and innovation of recreational sports
Attention must be paid to sufficient exercise incentives right from the start of childcare.
In the school sports policy we encourage and support successful concepts such as Multimove and Brede School.
By, among other things, making open spaces more exercise-friendly, we promote 'differently organised' forms of sport so that it is possible to make time for sport even during an active career.
Everyone should be able to play sports, including seniors, people with disabilities, the less wealthy, prisoners, etc.
That is why we support targeted partnerships such as the G-Sport Support Center.
We are further optimizing the training and further education offering for our sports trainers and sports club managers.
We are further developing the status for sports instructor/trainer.
Preventive investment in healthy and fair sports
We refine the sports medical suitability assessment based on medical insights.
We combat fraud in sports (e.g. match-fixing) through targeted awareness campaigns to ensure the integrity of our young athletes.
We are including the new WADA code and the extension of the biological passport in the Flemish regulations.
Top sports policy that offers prospects
We develop talent development programs within or outside the top sports school, so that a tailor-made program can be mapped out for each talent.
We are improving personnel policy for top sports trainers and top athletes, with extra attention to a personal development path and optimal support.
We are strengthening support for scientific research and scientific guidance aimed at improving performance.
We are further developing three top sports centres, one in Ghent, one in Antwerp and one in Leuven.
We cluster training infrastructure, support and sports science and sports medical guidance for a sport on one campus.
Sufficient and high-quality sports infrastructure
The initiative and responsibility for local sports infrastructure lies with local authorities.
The Flemish government can provide an additional (financial) boost through targeted calls for projects.
We evaluate the Bloso centers and, where necessary, adjust the long-term vision regarding investments.
In this way, we determine which centres we should invest in as a priority, and we place particular emphasis on supra-local sports infrastructure.
2.5.3. Valuable volunteer work
2.5.3.1. Vision
Volunteer work is a form of active citizenship and an indispensable link in the pursuit of a high-quality social fabric and greater social cohesion.
The N-VA wants to stimulate this form of social engagement in a targeted manner.
To achieve this, a number of barriers need to be removed.
A volunteer organization should be able to focus primarily on volunteer work, not on dealing with administrative red tape.
2.5.3.2. Change for Progress
We are simplifying the legislation and investigating the possibility of a non-profit organisation status with the same protection but fewer formalities than is currently the case.
We recognise the competencies that volunteers acquire during their deployment, but we leave it up to the associations to decide whether or not to certify this.
A coordinated Flemish volunteer policy must be implemented in a transversal manner, whereby each minister can be held accountable for his or her responsibilities.
We are tackling the fragmentation of expertise and information channels by developing an expertise centre for volunteer work.
We provide additional support to organizations that guide vulnerable volunteers.
Associations with an annual turnover of less than 25,000 euros (the current limit is 15,000 euros) are exempt from submitting VAT returns.
We urge the European Union to continue and deepen the comparative study following the Year of Volunteers (2011).
2.6. LIVING SAFELY TOGETHER
Every day, thousands of people, professionals and volunteers, are busy protecting us, providing us with assistance, ensuring our domestic and foreign security, combating, prosecuting and punishing nuisance, violence and crime.
They usually do this conscientiously and dutifully.
Yet all too often and too often we are disappointed in the justified expectations we place on them.
This is rarely their fault, but rather due to inadequate organization, inadequate functioning, a lack of resources,…
Three quarters of Flemish firefighters are volunteers.
They are under pressure due to new recruitment tests, more training hours, etc., while people forget that these people have a full-time job.
The equipment and maintenance of a fire service requires a lot of resources.
According to a 2007 agreement, the federal government and the municipalities should share the costs equally.
In practice, municipalities pay approximately 90% of the costs.
Seven years after the 2007 reforms, the structure to actually provide appropriate assistance is still lacking.
Successive rounds of cutbacks have reduced the operational readiness of the Civil Protection.
The unions fear that even flood relief efforts will be compromised.
The police services were reformed after the Dutroux crisis, but the effectiveness of the model introduced at that time – one police service at two levels – is under discussion.
There is still too little police on the streets because the police have to carry out tasks that can be entrusted to other actors.
The scale of the local police is far from optimal, the federal police has a structure that is too cumbersome, police training is fragmented so that officers are taught completely different training and procedures, ...
The federal police are facing a shortage of (financial) resources.
As early as 2010, specialists declared it 'operationally bankrupt'
. The situation has only gotten worse since then.
The consequences are well known: the effectiveness of specialist services is weakened, IT projects fail despite expensive consultants, stocks (from ballpoint pens to car tyres) are sometimes exhausted, etc.
The financing of the 195 local police zones is also shaky.
With 60% of the population, Flanders receives only 47% of the federal resources.
Organizing a neighborhood police force becomes extremely difficult.
Some police zones even went to court to claim arrears from the Road Safety Fund.
There are enough police officers – there are even more per inhabitant than in our neighbouring countries – but they are not deployed efficiently.
It is illustrative that more federal money has been allocated to the security of the royal family than to the security of the entire Leuven or Mechelen police zone.
Ideas such as deploying city guards as police officers illustrate the total lack of attention to greater efficiency.
The number of judges in our country is also higher than in neighbouring countries.
We have twice as many magistrates per inhabitant as the Netherlands, and yet our justice system does not work nearly as well.
The justice system is struggling with judicial backlogs, excessive formalism and IT problems that are never resolved.
By punishing perpetrators too late or too lightly, the feeling of impunity increases.
A feeling that is reinforced by the fact that judges still hand down sentences that are either not carried out or are greatly reduced.
Perpetrators are released too early.
The prisons are old and overcrowded.
Those who are released do not receive sufficient guidance, which in turn results in a higher rate of recidivism.
The reform initiated in 1998 is not completed.
While almost everyone in Flanders advocates the introduction of a single court, the PS is opposing it.
For our defense we largely depend on international cooperation.
To carry out this task, Belgium has registered with international associations such as the Benelux naval cooperation and NATO.
The army is constantly active abroad: Afghanistan, Lebanon, DR Congo, Mali, the Central African Republic,…
International tasks and international partnerships require investments.
By NATO standards, a modern army should spend 20 to 25% of its defense budget on this.
Belgium reaches 7%.
Major investment projects are being put on the back burner.
This has consequences for the international image of our army, for the attractiveness of the military profession, but above all for the safety of the troops on the ground.
2.6.1. Fire brigade and civil security
2.6.1.1. Vision
A correct approach and good coordination can prevent a lot of suffering in the event of disasters.
The services involved are now investigating disasters, but each from their own policy domain, which means that an overall picture is lacking.
We must learn lessons from disaster management, not just from each facet of prevention or relief separately, but from a holistic approach.
The fire brigade in Flanders is 75 percent run by volunteers who have a (full-time) job.
As stated in the law since 2007, agreements must be made with employers regarding deployment, training and testing.
Keeping the fire brigade operational is a major cost for local authorities.
In addition to the efficiency exercise that must be carried out in the context of the fire service reform, the federal government must honour its commitment and share the costs with the municipalities.
2.6.1.2. Change for Progress
We will set up a Committee V, under the supervision of Parliament, which will investigate disasters from an overall picture.
Not to look for scapegoats, but to learn lessons and respond (even) better next time.
In this way, disasters can be prevented or their consequences limited.
Our firefighters will receive an adapted status, based on the legal position of municipal officials,
including an appropriate and beneficial system for volunteers.
We support employers whose employees are active as volunteers in emergency services and recognise the training of volunteer firefighters and members of the civil protection service as part of educational leave.
In accordance with the 2007 agreements, the federal government will cover half of the fire brigade costs.
We are integrating Civil Protection into the fire service, which will increase the effectiveness of the service (permanence, guaranteed assistance).
We are better coordinating the various emergency response zones (fire brigade, police, medical assistance) and, in principle, allowing them to coincide.
2.6.2. A police policy that gives a lick of punishment
2.6.2.1. Vision
Adequate policing is not possible without efficient use of resources.
There are enough police officers, but they are not deployed effectively enough.
An expensive police training program is not designed to have someone sit behind a word processor most of the time.
Police officers should be on the streets.
Other government services or even the private sector may take over certain administrative or support tasks.
Cutting back on management positions is also advisable to get more people into the field.
Adequate policing is also not possible without the correct distribution of resources.
Transfers are also unacceptable here.
Federal resources must be distributed logically and according to objective criteria, so that the Flemish police zones receive their correct share.
Each police zone must perform the same core tasks of basic policing.
That requires sufficient scale.
Today some police zones are too small.
In Brussels, which has six police zones, it is high time to adapt the structure to the metropolitan reality.
2.6.2.2. Change for Progress
Tit-for-tat policy
There is no such thing as petty or major crime.
People experience both equally.
To allow minor violations of the law is to sow the seeds of major crimes.
That is why we must intervene immediately and punish any violation.
Safety starts with preventive policies in all their forms (social cohesion, education, integration, etc.) and also includes repression and victim care.
We provide an international response to cross-border crime.
The EU can and must also create added value here.
We support initiatives to strengthen cooperation between police and judicial services through Europol and Eurojust and to further implement mutual police and judicial measures.
Special attention is paid to awareness-raising and intensive prevention in the field of both legal intoxicants and illegal narcotics.
In this respect, a policy of tolerance for soft drugs sends the wrong signal; legalisation is out of the question.
Our society may and must have the ambition to reduce drug addiction and reintegrate victims into society and the labor market.
The answer to users lies in prevention policy, assistance,
but also in law enforcement.
We take tough action against dealers.
More blue on the streets
We are merging the police zones in Flanders that are too small and the six police zones in Brussels.
At the same time, we ensure the proximity of the police on the basis of decentralised operations within the zones.
This means that the resources can be deployed where they are needed: on the ground.
And in this way the police can be close and quick to the citizens.
We are having a fundamental debate about the core tasks of the police, including in relation to other and private security and emergency services.
We deploy police officers for police duties and citizens for administrative tasks.
The increase in scale and increased efficiency will free up resources to invest in, among other things, more police on the streets and neighbourhood work.
We are simplifying the police structure.
The current optimization plan should only be a stepping stone.
Contact with citizens must also be central, including via social media.
We are drastically reducing the number of mandate positions (top jobs with a fixed term).
We aim for a well-trained police force with a correct status.
We organize police training in a limited number of schools with clear final objectives, uniform procedures and high quality requirements.
This will increase the quality of the training.
By limiting the number of police schools, the various emergency services (police, fire brigade, emergency services, etc.) can be trained together, which will benefit future cooperation.
A modern personnel statute, with functional remuneration instead of a proliferation of allowances, allowances and bonuses, ensures a more transparent and fairer wage policy.
The deployment of police officers is not without risk.
Violence against police officers is all too common.
People with a public task (other emergency services, public transport personnel, etc.) deserve additional protection.
We implement a no-holds-barred policy that tackles violence against them.
Modern and efficient police
The police will receive a modern ICT infrastructure and data management will be optimised (for example by using the same IT system for the federal and local police).
We integrate new communication technologies such as social media, SMS for emergency calls and tracking messages, and reports via webcam.
We create a clear legal framework that regulates and stimulates the use of social media.
We are rationalising the inspection services (the Internal Supervision services, the General Inspection and the P Committee), whose tasks partly overlap.
We include the General Inspection in the P Committee.
We are redistributing the resources for the police zones, in particular the federal subsidy to the police zones and the proceeds from the federal Road Safety Fund.
We organize these financing flows more objectively and logically.
Since there is no longer any point in curtailing the political rights of local police officers, we allow them to run for municipal elections when the municipality in question is outside the zone in which they are professionally active.
2.6.3. A swift justice system that punishes effectively
2.6.3.1. Vision
Justice is a matter that is par excellence personal and therefore actually belongs to the Communities.
With the sixth state reform, some powers were transferred to Flanders, including a form of positive injunction law.
This is important because Flemish regulations must also be enforceable.
But Flanders still has too few instruments.
Being heard is one thing, the Belgian justice system must also respond to the questions.
Until Flanders can implement its own justice policy, the N-VA will continue to insist on the need for reforms at the federal policy level.
Services must be faster, more efficient and more effective.
This is only possible with sound legislation, good enforcement and good legal proceedings.
The first steps have been taken to improve the functioning of the judiciary, but the reform must go much further.
The fact that the majority in Wallonia has a different view of justice than the majority in Flanders does not make this any easier.
The internal organisation of the justice system must enable magistrates to work better and more efficiently.
Structures need to be simpler with fewer superiors and more responsibility.
Judges should be able to make more management decisions themselves without the minister having to constantly intervene.
A high-performance workload measurement identifies problems and needs.
There is much progress to be made in the field of computerisation and the associated electronic litigation.
Procedures can and should be simplified, while respecting the rights of the defence.
The N-VA also sees a special role for the single court.
She can provide better services to those seeking justice.
This will create a single point of contact for those who have to go to the 'ordinary' court of first instance, the commercial court, the labour court, etc.
In doing so, we avoid conflicts of jurisdiction between courts and give the chief of police more opportunities to efficiently fill the necessary functions within the district and to allow judges to specialize.
Impunity must be tackled from a holistic perspective.
We tackle the slow procedures,
the inadequate enforcement of sentences with the improper use of alternative punishment and premature releases,
and equally the overcrowded and outdated prisons.
The judge returns to center stage; he determines the sentence which is then effectively carried out, he decides whether or not to release the person early.
The punishment must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offences and not in proportion to the overcrowding of prisons.
At the same time, we focus on individualized guidance, reintegration into society and treatment for those who need it.
The EU was given additional powers in the area of ​​justice under the Treaty of Lisbon.
More European cooperation is a good thing and even necessary, because crime does not stop at borders.
The EU must, however, take into account the sensitivities and the specific organisation in each Member State.
2.6.3.2. Change for Progress
Punish quickly and correctly
We develop efficient fast-track justice for simple cases such as riots or shoplifting.
The justice policy is failing.
That is why municipal administrative sanctions (GAS fines) are an effective and necessary alternative to tackle certain forms of nuisance and vandalism.
They can only be successful and last when they are used usefully and wisely.
Any sentence imposed by a judge will be carried out as pronounced by the judge; the minister cannot simply convert it into electronic monitoring.
Other interference by the executive branch, such as the king's right of pardon, is also unacceptable.
We entrust the right of mercy to the criminal enforcement courts.
An amendment to the legislation ensures that procedural errors do not necessarily lead to annulment.
Electronic monitoring should become a fully-fledged alternative to prison sentences for perpetrators of minor crimes.
However, this is only possible if the judge decides and provided there is sufficient supervision, guidance and control.
Conditional release is a privilege, not a right.
We only make them possible when at least three-fifths of the prison sentence has been served, and in the event of recidivism, even after three-quarters.
Strict conditions must be imposed and applied.
Anyone who does not comply with this, we will lock up again.
To combat prison overcrowding, we are expanding prison capacity and modernizing the prison system.
By building new prisons and renting capacity in the Netherlands, we temporarily create overcapacity so that sentences can be carried out effectively.
We are moving away from the system where all prisoners undergo the same prison regime.
For example, we treat adolescents who have received a first conviction differently.
We conclude enforceable bilateral agreements with the countries whose foreigners populate our prisons,
so that they can serve their prison sentence in their country of origin.
We are setting up a parliamentary Committee T.
It is charged with monitoring the terrorism policy about which parliamentarians receive little information today.
Supervision of convicts
With an individual detention plan we prepare the detainee for the smoothest possible reintegration.
We make optimal use of the justice houses to provide further guidance to ex-prisoners after their release.
They really should be given a second chance so that recidivism can be prevented.
We provide customized programs for the guidance of delinquent youth, with rapid, tailor-made punishment.
They are held accountable for their responsibilities and the recovery of the victims is central.
Mentally ill inmates do not belong in prison, but receive appropriate treatment according to the degree of their disability.
We offer drug users the opportunity to kick the habit in a separate wing of the prison.
Reform of the judiciary
A workload measurement at all courts forms the basis for further judicial reform.
Not only the courts of appeal, but all courts, including the justices of the peace, must be examined.
We are simplifying the structure by creating a single court with specialised chambers and a single public prosecutor's office, which brings together all the courts in each district under the leadership of a single manager.
This way, the workload can be better distributed and citizens have one point of contact.
The seats will remain where they are now.
After all, justice is at the service of the citizen and must be accessible.
We have courts managed by a manager and from the court itself; It is not Brussels that should decide which lamp should be replaced and when.
We are initiating a catch-up movement in computerization.
E-mail must be able to make its entrance, files must be able to be managed electronically.
Videoconferencing should be made possible, for example for remote hearings.
This saves money, is safer and cheaper.
Correct and smooth administration of justice
Simpler legislation prevents procedural complications that lead to delays and backlogs, and even to acquittals in which any sense of justice disappears.
For each legal domain, we have a committee of experts draw up a new, logical and modern code.
Points of attention include: the drastic reduction of the more than one thousand limitation periods, more accessible language use and a revaluation of the first instance.
Today, it is sometimes too easy to appeal and people wait too long to use all the arguments.
The Communities fully support primary assistance.
It is a buffer that can relieve the second line and the judicial system.
In the second line, we are working on better monitoring of pro bono lawyers.
The victim is given a single point of contact, the judicial assistant, who provides information about the status of the file and the progress of the investigation and the process.
Victim support and mediation between perpetrator and victim must become a reflex of the police and the judiciary.
It cannot be that a victim should pay the legal costs when a perpetrator goes free due to lack of evidence.
In that case, the Victim Support Fund must bear the costs.
Enforcing Flemish standards will remain in federal hands even after the sixth state reform.
The various Flemish policy areas prepare their own criminal law policies; For the coordination between the Flemish domains and the federal authorities, we are setting up a single Flemish coordination platform.
2.6.4. A deployable army that fulfills its international duty
2.6.4.1. Vision
The N-VA wants a high-performance, versatile army,
which will eventually be incorporated into a Benelux military project
as an intermediate step towards a European army.
If we want to guarantee our own security and that of our allies, we must continue to invest in our defense.
The armed forces must also be able to operate within a stable framework.
Financial stability can be achieved through ‘defense agreements’ such as those in Denmark or France.
They determine the long-term defense policy, assignments and associated resources.
That is why the opposition is involved in closing it.
In this way, the army can rely on the necessary stability and an effective policy can be developed.
Defence must invest wisely so that we can continue to count on a broad mix of capabilities with our partners.
Investment files must have an international reflex.
After all, we have international commitments and must be able to meet them.
This means that we must determine together with our partners what capacity is available and what capacity is needed and must be provided within the framework of international cooperation.
The military is evolving into a specialized, high-tech organization.
The importance of ICT is increasing.
Social and cultural knowledge and skills are also important when operating in different places around the world.
Military recruitment and training policies must take this into account.
The shorter military career is a step forward in making the military profession more attractive, but at the same time more attention must be paid to the transition to the civilian labour market.
Foreign deployment preferably takes place within NATO or the EU context and only with the green light from the international community.
Selectivity in foreign deployment is advisable.
The focus should be on assignments where we are needed and where our expertise provides effective added value.
The foreign deployment must also fit within the role and assignments as stated in the defense agreements.
This democratic legitimacy includes an obligation to provide information.
When the government decides to deploy armed forces, parliament must be informed about the deployment and its possible impact.
Parliament must also be kept regularly informed during operations and a final evaluation must be carried out afterwards.
2.6.4.2. Change for Progress
The majority and the opposition lay down the resources, tasks and plans for the army in a 'defense agreement' for a period of five years.
This allows for targeted work on these tasks and clarity about the resources required.
We view investment and replacement projects for equipment and infrastructure in the light of international partnerships.
This can lead to greater efficiency, a more rational use of resources and specialization,
but also requires a commitment from our defense.
We are rationalizing the number of missions.
We limit our efforts to a number of assignments where our participation is necessary and our expertise provides added value.
A more concentrated deployment ensures that more soldiers can go on foreign missions.
We are further developing international cooperation in general and Benelux cooperation in particular, across all components.
In this way we are gradually working towards an army for the Low Countries.
There should be an obligation to provide information about deployment in foreign missions, before, during and after the mission.
The army serves democracy.
Parliament must be optimally involved in decisions on major investment projects.
The military is not an island in society.
Recruitment must ensure that society is reflected in the defense personnel.
Where possible, we have certain functions performed by citizens.
There must also be better cooperation with the civil sector in the field of education.
We are developing a flexible(r) personnel policy, with an eye for well-being and a smooth transition to the civilian sector at the end of the military career.
CHOOSING OUR FUTURE
The government is there for the citizens, for the associations, for the companies – not the other way around.
Without their initiatives, their commitment, their efforts, their investments, we would be nowhere.
The government may (and must) only create the framework, create the conditions and provide the space in which people, associations and companies can develop to their full potential – in freedom and responsibility, with rights and obligations.
In a healthy democracy, people must be able to identify with their government.
Therefore, they should be given the policies they choose.
Because this is increasingly less the case in the 'two-river country' of Belgium, Flemish democracy must be given its own foundation in a confederal institutional architecture.
A recognizable government is as close to the citizens as possible.
That is the principle of subsidiarity: governing at the lowest possible level at which governance is (still) effective.
That is why we must strengthen the administrative capacity and autonomy of our municipalities.
Precisely because the government does not exist for itself, but for citizens, associations and companies, it must work efficiently and therefore cheaply: the best possible service at the lowest possible price.
This does not only apply to the administration and civil servants.
This applies in particular to the government and parliament, to representatives and politicians.
Citizens rightly expect that they serve the public interest, govern with integrity and produce quality regulations.
3.1. TOWARDS A CONFEDERAL MODEL
Federal Belgium is creaking at the seams.
Flemish and French speakers hardly or never reach an agreement on fundamental issues.
This was and is the case with regard to the approach to the financial and economic crisis, with regard to the reform of the judiciary, with regard to migration and asylum policy, with regard to social security – and so on.
The opposing views, insights and preferences run through almost all policy domains.
Two completely different starting points can never produce a clear and effective solution.
This can only result in a solution that pleases either one region or no one. A solution that is therefore not a solution.
A solution where everyone loses.
That is the price that Flemish and French speakers pay for the current system.
They don't get the policies they vote for.
They are left with policies that continue to muddle through and fail to implement much-needed structural reforms.
Structural change is only possible if we can tackle our own problems with our own solutions and our own money, and on our own responsibility.
Successive state reforms have attempted to mitigate that democratic price tag.
They resulted in an inscrutable federal state order.
The powers of the federation, the Communities and the Regions are still not logically demarcated.
The citizen is lost and does not get what he is entitled to.
The clash of visions between Flemish and French-speaking people and the unwillingness/inability to make fundamental reforms saddle us with a tax burden, wage costs and government expenditure that are among the highest in the world and are still increasing.
The national debt is so high that the interest on it takes up a significant portion of the annual budget resources and therefore cannot be used for 'normal' policy.
Another sore point is the way in which solidarity is organised within Belgium today, the transfers from Flanders to Wallonia and Brussels.
The amount has risen to eight billion euros – a sum that can no longer be called reasonable, especially because of the perverse effects of this so-called solidarity.
Indeed, the transfers do not at all encourage better policies or responsibility, but confirm the dependence of Wallonia and Brussels.
The sixth state reform adjusted the derailed solidarity mechanism of the Special Financing Act.
But in combination with other elements, transfers will increase even further.
Moreover, even after the sixth state reform, little has been achieved in terms of making the federal states more responsible.
3.1.1. Vision
It is clear that Flemish and French speakers want to take different paths.
Therefore, we can no longer continue to waste time, money and energy on community discussions.
This country needs change.
No state reform like the previous six, in which the Flemish, in exchange for a large bag of money, saw their democratic majority further reduced and their position in Brussels weakened again and again
This was and is the case with regard to the approach to the financial and economic crisis, with regard to the reform of the judiciary, with regard to migration and asylum policy, with regard to social security – and so on.
The classical technique of state reform has become a disastrous and money-consuming perpetual motion machine.
In the short term, we can immediately change course in the Wetstraat.
But if we want to change something structurally, we have to change the structures.
The N-VA demonstrated how this is possible at its Change for Progress conference on 31 January, 1 and 2 February 2014.
There we have mapped out the path that leads to the Belgian Confederation.
The Belgian Confederation consists of the regions of Flanders and Wallonia, which own all powers.
They can exercise these powers themselves, or decide to exercise certain powers together at the confederal level.
In the Confederation, the Brussels-Capital region and the German-speaking region have a special status.
The Brussels-Capital region is made responsible and is assigned land-related powers.
At the same time, the capital's function is being strengthened in Brussels, ties with Flanders and Wallonia are being strengthened and the regions are exercising their personal powers there.
With our confederal project, we are turning the logic of the six previous state reforms upside down.
Instead of transferring powers from the federal level to Flanders and Wallonia, powers can be transferred from the federated entities to the confederal level.
Voluntary cooperation works better than forced cooperation.
This is evident from the matters on which the Flemish and Walloon governments are already consulting directly with each other today and reaching good agreements.
Must becomes want.
Breaking down from above becomes building up from below.
Confederalism ensures a lean and transparent government that works more efficiently – and therefore more cheaply – with institutions that are prepared to work together instead of working against each other.
In this way we enable Flemish and French speakers to take their destiny into their own hands.
Everyone can implement the change they believe they need, according to their own insights, under their own responsibility, and with their own money.
3.1.2. Change for Progress
For the concrete proposals regarding confederalism, we refer to the resolutions of our congress Change for Progress.
3.2. RESPONSIBLE AND INTEGRITY GOVERNANCE
Belgium has had a cumbersome, heavy and extensive government apparatus for many years.
Of the 3.875 million employees, approximately one third are employed by the government in one way or another: from the municipality and education to the welfare sector and the European Commission.
In recent years, measures have been taken at all levels of government to slim down the government.
The number of civil servants has fallen, both at the federal level and in Flanders.
At the same time, the government is making efforts to work in a customer-friendly manner,
to implement a modern personnel policy,
to make maximum use of information and communication technology (ICT),
to be open and innovative,
to organize supporting activities (facility management) in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.
In this regard, Flanders is much further ahead than the federal government.
The fact that the Flemish government received the Randstad Award 2013 as the most attractive employer in the public sector is a recognition of its HR policy and of the employees who provide services to citizens and companies every day.
As part of the sixth state reform, approximately 4,500 federal civil servants will be transferred to the Communities and Regions, together with their powers and part of their financial resources.
That still leaves about 73,500 federal civil servants.
An objective efficiency exercise should lead to further rationalization and downsizing.
The Flemish Government will not only have to ensure the smooth integration of the transferred civil servants, but will also have to investigate, entity by entity, what the specific personnel needs are in order to enable more efficient governance.
Some tasks may require more civil servants, others fewer.
Since the introduction of the BBB organisational structure (Better Administrative Policy) in the Flemish administration, entities can take decisions with a great deal of autonomy in the areas of budget, personnel and daily operations.
Making the services and leading officials more accountable is a positive development.
However, the compartmentalization has remained intact.
There is still too much work done in parallel for common personnel policy, ICT, accounting, data collection, etc.
BBB should actually function as a holding structure, but the parent company that takes on the shared services is missing.
With its thirteen policy areas, the same number of departments and 60 agencies, the Flemish government is still too cumbersome.
There are too many entities, which makes management difficult, and the separation between policy preparation and policy implementation is too strict.
In recent years, the downsizing has focused on the merger of management support services and the elimination of ten agencies (from 70 to 60) and several strategic advisory councils.
In a next move, further and more radical steps must be taken.
Unlike the Flemish government and although it has been mandatory since 2002, the federal government still does not have a comprehensive audit policy.
Earlier this year, the chairman of the Federal Audit Committee resigned because he received too little support from the federal government.
In twelve years, barely half of federal civil servants have been evaluated.
Of the 78,000 civil servants, only five were dismissed because they did not perform.
The Flemish government, on the other hand, takes the annual evaluations seriously, both for civil servants and their managers.
In 2012, 173 civil servants were forced to leave the Flemish government; nine percent of them had permanent appointments.
After all, the thousands of civil servants who work every day to provide correct and good services should not be the victims of a few who do not do so.
Another federal sore point is the application of language legislation.
Twelve years after the 2002 amendment to the law and despite the explicit commitment of State Secretary Bogaert, top civil servants are still not required to be bilingual.
According to the Federal Planning Bureau, the administrative burdens that weigh on our companies and the self-employed have fallen by a quarter since 2000.
In recent years, however, the decline has stalled.
The Planning Bureau estimated the cost of these charges in 2012 at 6.36 billion euros.
This is virtually a stabilization compared to 2010.
Small businesses bear about half of it.
3.2.1. A lean, efficient and modern government
3.2.1.1. Vision
Both the federal and Flemish governments must continue, and where necessary increase, their efforts to make their administrative services an efficient, transparent, effective and customer-friendly organisation, and to implement a contemporary personnel policy.
Every government must focus even more on its actual tasks, from the customer's perspective: the citizen, the association, the organisation, the company.
Certain tasks require reinforcement, others can and should be delegated.
The government must have the ambition to be an attractive employer.
Employees who work well should be rewarded for this.
In its personnel policy, the government focuses on attractive employment conditions, internal mobility, employees who dare to take responsibility,
labor participation of target groups,
objectification of the remuneration policy through job weighting,…
and this with good environmental factors (e.g. investments in IT and facility management).
She is gradually moving to a fully contractual civil service.
The organizational structure of the Flemish government is due for revision by drastically reducing the number of entities,
to abolish the strict separation between policy preparation (departments) and policy implementation (agencies)
and to establish a flexible, adaptable structure around processes and policy priorities.
Similar measures are also needed at the federal level.
The ‘classic’ government structure with FODs and PODs can be much more efficient.
In social security, for example, the various institutions need to be better streamlined from an organizational point of view.
The various parastatals, often with similar tasks, are still largely based on the historical structures, although financing is no longer only provided by employer and employee contributions, but also to a significant extent by taxes.
The merger of services that are related in terms of content results in economies of scale and material gains (less overhead, fewer managers, etc.).
Attempts have already been made in this regard in the past.
Often these were only partially implemented or even failed completely.
Consider the federal eHR project that went back and forth between the FPS HR and Fedict and may be moved back to HR.
In the meantime, millions of euros and seven years have passed.
3.2.1.2. Change for Progress
We are implementing further savings in government personnel and operating costs through targeted measures.
We decide which tasks to strengthen and which to divest, partly based on external audits.
Support services ensure that executive services can focus on their actual mission.
With a view to standardization and maximum efficiency, we purchase more centrally and we do this as much as possible at every level of government as a whole.
We bring together the policy preparation and implementation entities that guide real estate transactions of the Flemish government.
The transfer of purchasing committees in the context of the sixth state reform offers the opportunity to cluster notarial real estate transactions.
We are setting up a real estate fund that can respond flexibly to opportunities within a clear framework.
We provide other support services, such as HR, at each government level.
This not only concerns recruitment or training, but also management of personnel files.
Naturally, individual services will be given sufficient control over recruitment so that specific profiles can be attracted for specific functions.
We optimize the operation of Jobpunt Vlaanderen on the one hand and Selor on the other.
We are fully mobilising both organisations for the recruitment of government managers in order to put an end once and for all to the horse-trading surrounding political appointments.
We are continuing to develop a modern personnel policy, including by introducing a flexible labour market allowance for bottleneck professions (including ICT functions) and a remuneration policy that is aligned with job weightings.
We implement a modern diversity policy with attention to the different target groups. Where possible, we make the targets more ambitious.
For this we refer to chapter 2.1.3. Equal opportunities.
We are establishing a single independent external audit service that will monitor the efficiency and integrity of all federal government services.
This enables us to help eliminate risks and improve service provision.
We are strengthening customer focus by making greater use of digital submission and processing of applications and documents, and by processing files faster and in a more solution-oriented manner.
We also think of matters such as e-Health or the digital file in the justice system.
With respect for privacy, we make as much 'open data' collected by the government public as possible.
This is not only relevant for scientific research, companies and developers can also use these datasets.
Following the example of the Flemish government, we are introducing a compensation scheme at the federal government to limit administrative burdens.
Whenever a law or regulation imposes a new burden, it must be compensated for by removing an obligation elsewhere.
We are finally implementing mandatory bilingualism for top federal officials.
We annually evaluate all civil servants, both federal and Flemish.
Government managers and mandate holders are also included in this exercise.
We give leading civil servants greater (also financial) responsibility.
Services provided to other entities are invoiced mutually.
A bonus system allows an entity that achieves better results than expected to retain part of the additional results to take its own initiatives.
Leading officials are given additional powers to evaluate, stimulate and penalise.
We are also looking into the possibility of making part of the mandate holders' salaries variable and paying them out based on the achievement of pre-set objectives.
Unless there are substantive reasons or arguments for independence (such as Audit Flanders, De Lijn, VRT, VDAB and the regulators), we will abolish the strict division between department (policy preparation and policy evaluation) and agency (policy implementation) in the Flemish government.
We are dividing the Flemish government into more homogeneous units and transforming it into logical and indivisible clusters of activities that can never be split up among several ministers.
At the same time, there must be a one-on-one relationship between the minister and the entity.
Within the Flemish government, we are merging the following policy areas or agencies: the policy areas of Administrative Affairs (BZ) and Services for General Government Policy (DAR); the policy areas of Economy, Science and Innovation (EWI) and Work and Social Economy (WSE); a new policy domain of Spatial Development as a merger of Environment, Nature and Energy (LNE) and Spatial Planning, Housing Policy and Immovable Heritage (RWO); the Waterways and Sea Canal and Shipping agencies; the various entities that deal with information.
At the federal level, we are looking at where the traditional government structure can be modernised.
We do this, for example, for the various parastatals in social security, each of which performs similar tasks within their specific domain.
We will absorb as much of the new powers that are transferred to the Flemish government in the implementation of the sixth state reform as possible in existing entities. We avoid the creation of new agencies.
The European Union is best served by a smaller but powerful European Commission that focuses on European priorities.
Following the original arrangement included in the Lisbon Treaty, we support a rotation system based on equality between all Member States.
3.2.2. Honest directors and quality regulations
The sixth state reform also included a component of 'political renewal'.
However, the measures taken are far too limited to make a difference.
The major reform that was initially talked about did not happen.
The Senate has not been abolished; it has only become a non-directly elected institution, but with a permanent cost of approximately 60 million euros per year.
A huge sum for an institution that is increasingly losing importance.
In addition, the traditional parties, together with Groen-Ecolo, have ensured that approximately 10 million euros of the cancelled Senate grants will be compensated via the Chamber of Representatives.
The Federal Ethics Commission, which was set up to modernise the rules on conflicts of interest, ethics, remuneration and foreign missions, is a watchdog without teeth.
It is unlikely that she will be anything more than a talking shop with no moral authority.
There was absolutely no innovation in the practice of top appointments under the Di Rupo government.
All the positions to be distributed were recorded in a 'land registry' and then months of pushing, pulling, blocking, haggling and bullying took place to ensure that all the positions were evenly distributed among the majority parties.
In gratitude for their support for the sixth state reform, Groen and Ecolo received two additional parliamentary staff members from the majority parties, at the taxpayer's expense.
The Federal Parliament and the Flemish Parliament approved a new scheme for the severance pay of their members.
It is incomprehensible that the federal regulation deviates significantly on certain points from the stricter regulation of the Flemish Parliament, as developed by Parliament President Jan Peumans.
While the Flemish Government reduced the number of cabinet staff from 452 in the previous term of office to 288 (-36%) in the expiring term, the reduction at the federal level remained limited to 11% (from 932 to 827).
The number of federal ministers may have decreased; The number of cabinet staff has increased from an average of 40 per government member to 44.
Belgians residing abroad only have the right to vote in federal elections
. The N-VA proposed to also give them the right to vote in the regional parliaments.
Despite their previous positions, the other Flemish parties did not respond to this – purely for electoral strategic reasons.
It is incomprehensible that Flemish people in Flanders are forced to vote, but Flemish people abroad are denied the right to vote for the Flemish Parliament.
3.2.2.1. Vision
Organizing and directing society: that is the important and noble task of politics.
This requires competent and honest administrators who use the resources they are given as economically and effectively as possible.
However, confidence in political institutions (parliament, government, parties) is low, and the reputation of politicians (ministers, members of parliament) is modest.
To maintain and strengthen its legitimacy, politics must restore its credibility and improve the quality of its personnel.
People should not live with the idea that politicians are more concerned with themselves than with the general interest, or that politicians demand efforts from citizens and companies but are not sufficiently economical with the available government resources.
Whether credibility can be restored and trust increased depends largely on the behavior of each individual politician.
In addition, collective measures are needed.
In 2009, the N-VA reached out to the other parties and put twenty proposals on the table to bring a breath of fresh air to politics.
Unfortunately, the other parties did not respond to this.
Many of our proposals remain valid.
3.2.2.2. Change for Progress
We are abolishing the Senate without further ado.
Its added value as a 'reflection chamber' was already limited, the sixth state reform has completely undermined that function.
Its cost/benefit ratio was already skewed; after the sixth state reform, the costs outweigh the benefits less than ever before.
Pending the abolition, we will ensure that the support services of the House of Representatives and the Senate work together more closely and, where possible, even merge them.
We start the parliamentary working year on September 1.
The far too long summer recess is hindering proper parliamentary work and permanent control of the government.
We will equate the severance pay of federal parliamentarians with that of Flemish parliamentarians (a base of five months, and one month per mandate year with a maximum of 24 months).
A Minister may not engage in any activity that may compromise the dignity of the office and/or undermine public confidence in the office, affect his or her own independence or create a conflict between competing interests.
Such a deontological rule already exists at Flemish level and must also be introduced at federal level.
By analogy with the European rules for European Commissioners, a minister may not take up any position in the business community for several months after his mandate, at least in the sectors for which he was responsible as a minister.
The current regulations are too limited and do not rule out a number of abuses.
We are turning the Federal Ethics Commission into a real watchdog that can act in individual cases on its own initiative or on the initiative of a third party, and not only at the request of the mandate holder himself.
Its advice must be made public to enforce compliance with ethical rules.
Parliament must be able to intervene effectively when an official violates the ethical rules.
We will abolish compulsory voting.
The voter must be free to exercise or not exercise his democratic right to vote.
The government and political parties must encourage citizens to vote in elections.
Voting rights instead of compulsory voting forces politicians to engage in politics in a different way.
The certainty that everyone must vote makes politicians rest too much on their laurels.
In countries without compulsory voting, turnout figures provide an important indication of the health of the political climate.
We have the cost price of the election programs calculated by the Court of Audit.
This will oblige the parties to make their programmes as concrete and realistic as possible.
We also grant Flemish people abroad the right to vote in the elections of the Flemish Parliament.
Now they can only participate in the Chamber elections.
We do not allow the federal and state elections to coincide.
Simultaneous elections are completely contrary to the autonomy that Flanders has acquired.
In no federal country are federal and state elections held on the same day.
Each level of policy must be able to be assessed separately on its own merits.
The monarchy is an outdated form of government, birthright does not correspond with basic democratic principles.
In the transition phase towards the introduction of the republican form of government, we are transforming the Belgian monarchy into a protocol monarchy.
No more political orders; no co-signature; no formation assignments; no foreign missions without the agreement of the federal states; no pardons; no new noble titles; no military functions;...
Only the head of state and his or her spouse bear the title of king and queen.
The King's chief of staff will, as in the Netherlands, be subject to political supervision.
In the interests of the quality of the regulations and the transparency of government, we make the advice of the Council of State public, so that citizens and government can take it into account.
We also have the Council of State provide advice on constitutional amendments.
Parliament is free to deviate from the advice, but it obliges Parliament to explain and justify any deviations to the citizen.
3.2.3. Strong municipalities
During the past administrative period, important steps were taken to strengthen municipal administrative power under the impetus of Minister of the Interior Geert Bourgeois and on the basis of the White Paper on Internal State Reform.
This reduced the planning burden and made far-reaching cooperation between the municipality and the OCMW possible.
The municipal council also came back to the centre of the debate through the obligation to discuss the policy of the inter-municipal associations in the municipal council.
In addition, municipalities are supported in managing their finances by, among other things, maintaining the 3.5% growth rate of the Municipal Fund.
In addition, the political and administrative structures were lightened.
Yet many of our municipalities are unable to meet the expectations and challenges: regulations that are becoming increasingly complex, the ever-increasing demands that the population places on services,
the difficult search for technically trained and skilled personnel,
the lack of management of the local organization,…
The board is still too busy.
There are five ‘elected’ levels of government (local, provincial, regional, federal, European) with a sometimes difficult relationship with each other, there is the often complex administrative organisation within one and the same level of government and there is the intermediate level (intermunicipal companies) between municipality and province.
The regional screening carried out by Minister Bourgeois showed that there are 2,229 partnerships between municipalities and between municipalities and other authorities.
This labyrinth of partnerships (the administrative clutter) does not benefit transparency and democratic decision-making.
Many municipalities are experiencing financial difficulties, mainly due to a few federal cost drivers such as the police, the fire brigade and the rising pension costs of municipal employees.
Many municipal authorities are taking initiatives to work more efficiently and limit their expenditure, but at the same time they are looking to the federal and Flemish governments.
3.2.3.1. Vision
For the N-VA, the administrative organisation in Flanders is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
Two full-fledged political policy levels are sufficient: the local government and the Flemish government.
Continuing on the path taken with the White Paper on Internal State Reform, local government must be able to further develop into the most important government authority and the first point of contact for citizens.
In this two-tier governance model, there is no longer any need for the provinces.
Their tasks and resources can be transferred to the local level or, where desirable, to the Flemish level.
This also results in significant savings.
To fulfill its calling as the first government, local government must have sufficient administrative power.
We can give stronger and more responsible municipalities more powers, greater autonomy and more responsibility.
The transfer of powers in the context of the sixth state reform is an opportunity for this.
The Flemish government, and where this is still relevant, the federal government, must adopt a less patronising and centralistic approach.
In a strong municipality, the municipal council must have a say in strategic decisions and vision formation.
The municipal council members must receive the necessary information for this.
A good balance between the municipal council and the board of aldermen must be constantly monitored.
Stronger municipalities do not make cooperation redundant.
On the contrary.
Cooperation between municipalities must take place in a transparent manner and within permanent partnerships.
We must put an end to the administrative clutter that exists today.
To achieve all this, local authorities must be financially healthy.
They must therefore increase the efficiency of their operations and reduce their equipment costs, including through thorough integration between the municipality and the OCMW.
The efficiency exercise includes a reflection on the tasks to be retained and the tasks to be divested.
A thorough core task debate must be held in the municipal council.
3.2.3.2. Change for Progress
We are increasing the administrative capacity of our municipalities to give them more powers, autonomy and responsibility.
In this context, we examine which of the new powers that Flanders acquires as a result of the sixth state reform can be transferred to the municipalities.
When transferring powers to municipalities, we transfer the corresponding resources to the maximum extent possible.
In order to strengthen cooperation between the municipality and the OCMW and to be able to implement an integrated municipal social policy, we are removing the federal obstacles in the OCMW legislation and integrating the OCMW decree into the Municipal Decree.
We require small municipalities to merge the OCMW and municipal services.
In this integration, we provide guarantees for individual care provision, for example by establishing a special municipal council committee or a municipal EVA structure.
The healthcare companies fall directly under the municipality.
To simplify governance, we allow the various authorities to work in stronger and more transparent partnerships at the supra-municipal (regional) level.
We start from the regional screening carried out by Minister Bourgeois.
We monitor the decision-making procedures of these partnerships, in which the involvement of the municipal councils must be guaranteed.
In this context, the Flemish government is issuing a framework decree on intergovernmental cooperation.
We are providing more support to the ongoing pilot projects for setting up collaboration platforms between municipalities.
We require smaller municipalities to work together in permanent partnerships in a number of policy areas.
If desired, they can decide for themselves whether the bundling of forces will gradually result in a merger of the municipalities involved.
We are abolishing the provincial level of government.
The current role and resources of the provinces should preferably be shifted to the municipalities, the policy level closest to the citizen, if not to the Flemish government.
This is how we strengthen local democracy
and we make our municipalities financially healthier.
The decentralised services of the Flemish government (in the Flemish administrative centres and under the coordinating task of a manager-governor) can continue to carry out their tasks.
We integrate the resources of the Provincial Fund into the Municipal Fund.
To further revalue and strengthen the municipal council as the linchpin of the local democratic system, we are expanding the financial instruments.
BBC (policy and management cycle) to fire brigades, police zones and inter-municipal partnerships and we are developing the external audit for local authorities.
We are investigating additional initiatives to safeguard the financial position of the municipalities.
We are thinking primarily of municipalities that take initiatives with a view to economies of scale and efficiency, or of a new pact to support local authorities with a one-off initiative.
With a view to supporting administrative capacity, we are reforming the Municipal Fund and integrating the resources of the Provincial Fund, the Cities Fund, the Rural Fund and other sectoral subsidy flows into it.
We develop framework contracts or other instruments to control operating expenses.
We monitor municipal finances more closely in light of European regulations.
We are investigating whether additional standards are needed on top of the existing standards for municipalities in financial difficulties.
3.3. EUROPEAN FLEMISH, WORLD FLEMISH
We live in a small country with a large foreign country.
Developments anywhere in the world have consequences for Flanders.
The more globalization progresses, the greater those consequences will be.
That is why Flanders must have the ambition to be present in Europe and in the world, and to make its voice heard.
Independent and self-confident, open and supportive.
Since the introduction of the principle of ‘in foro interno, in foro externo’ in 1993, Flanders has been able to conduct its own foreign policy within its areas of competence.
Particularly under the then competent minister Geert Bourgeois, important efforts were made in the period 2004-2008 to profile our state internationally
. This dynamic came to a partial standstill during the 2009-2014 term of office.
Flanders' successful cooperation programme with the countries in Central and Eastern Europe has been discontinued.
On the positive side, cooperation with neighbouring countries has been continued, primarily with the Netherlands.
Unfortunately, this is done on an ad hoc basis, and no longer in the context of a formal strategy note.
Flanders' image abroad has increased thanks to the new brand policy in which the region of Flanders is presented as a separate entity based on its own strengths, both geographically and in terms of content.
Flanders also played a successful role during the Belgian EU presidency in 2010.
However, in the European choir, Flanders' voice is still not strong enough and loud enough.
Moreover, Flanders is confronted with symptoms of disregard by the federal government.
Federal attempts at recovery continue to hinder Flanders in conducting its own foreign policy in its areas of competence.
This is the case in the area of ​​economic policy and even in community matters such as culture.
The appointment of economic advisors by Minister Reynders was a sad illustration of this.
International trade and investment policy has been a Flemish responsibility for two decades and illustrates that what we do ourselves, we do better.
The adjustment of the intra-Belgian cooperation agreements on foreign policy has been put back on the table of the Interministerial Conference on Foreign Policy (ICBB) after a long time, but progress on this dossier has been substandard due to federal obstruction.
Federal diplomacy also remains in the same old bed.
The traditional political parties still divide the most important positions among themselves; Anyone who wants to become an ambassador in Washington or Paris must have a membership card from a traditional party, or better have close ties to the Court.
Foreign Minister Didier Reynders even wants to go a step further by appointing non-diplomats as ambassadors.
In recent years there have been several scandals involving ambassadors who failed to perform their duties properly, did not pay their fines, showed no respect for their host country or even engaged in espionage.
Furthermore, language skills at our embassies are very poor: Flemish people who renew their passport or driving licence at a Belgian consulate are often not helped in Dutch.
In the European Union, the agenda over the past five years has been dominated by the financial and economic crisis.
That crisis exposed the euro's structural flaws and imperfections.
However, the potential pitfalls were known long before the launch of the euro.
The expectation – or hope – that these imperfections would spontaneously resolve itself came up against a bitter and harsh reality.
Excessive debt accumulation, economic distortions between Member States and a loss of competitiveness pose a threat to the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
The EMU proved unable to absorb external shocks, such as the financial crisis, properly and efficiently, both economically and socially.
Citizens' trust in the EU has continued to decline in recent years, even in the founding Member States.
Support for the common project is eroding because democratic legitimacy is under pressure.
More and more people feel that they no longer have control over decision-making.
They no longer see the European Union as a boost to their prosperity, but as a threat to their freedom.
This downward trend was further fuelled by the prolonged euro crisis.
The crisis and the eroding support base expose a fundamental fault line.
Just like in Belgium, there is a different vision between north and south in the EU regarding savings and reforms.
Just as in Belgium, there is suspicion in the north about initiating even more transfers without greater accountability in return.
This polarization is not limited to north and south, but is also present between the left and right sides of the political spectrum.
An ever-expanding Union will further sharpen the differences between countries.
That is why citizen involvement is essential for the success of European cooperation.
Therefore, the principle of subsidiarity must be sufficiently recognised, as must the natural process of striving for autonomy of nations in Europe.
The distrust cannot simply be dismissed as a vote against Europe.
But it cannot be swept under the carpet either and we can move on to the agenda.
Such an attitude all too easily undermines the foundations of the EU.
European cooperation is a necessary means of achieving efficient governance in the interests of citizens.
That is precisely why it is necessary to continuously strive for improved cooperation and to question existing structures.
As a result of the 2008 crisis, the pressure on international cooperation budgets has increased enormously.
Dealing with the consequences of climate change also puts pressure on traditional development cooperation budgets.
The decline in budgets also weighs on the debate on development cooperation in general.
Notable elements in this regard are the fragmentation of government budgets across a multitude of projects and the demand for greater concentration in both themes and partner countries.
In the Belgian context, the unclear division of powers between the Flemish and federal levels is a brake on efficient development policy.
The federal government is committed externally in areas for which it is not internally responsible and therefore not specialised, such as education, agriculture, development education or university development cooperation.
NGOs have to submit their dossiers at different levels, partner countries and international organisations do not know which policy level to address, etc.
Moreover, the excesses of political regimes in certain developing countries raise questions about the efficiency of conventional development aid.
3.3.1. European Flemish
3.3.1.1. Vision
The future of the 6.5 million Flemish people lies in Europe.
The European Union has brought us peace for sixty years and contributed to our prosperity and well-being.
Our story is and will remain a European story: ‘Being Flemish to become European’.
The N-VA wants a strong Flanders in a strong Europe.
For the N-VA, Flanders and Europe are explicitly part of an 'and-and story'.
The two levels of government are not contradictory, on the contrary, they reinforce each other.
Together they must ensure greater prosperity and well-being.
Precisely because we care about Europe, we dare to ask questions about the European Union project.
Not out of doubt about the usefulness and importance of European cooperation, but because the EU cannot be taken for granted and can only count on sufficient support if it can and dares to make the right choices.
The N-VA is not a Eurosceptic party that wants to attack everything that is European.
However, we do listen to critical voices that are not always votes against the EU.
It often concerns people who are worried, who feel powerless, who do not understand EU policy.
We do not consider legitimate concerns about the European Union as an attack on the EU.
On this point we fundamentally differ in opinion from Europhoric parties.
As a Eurorealistic party, the N-VA opts for feasible and supported European cooperation that is rooted in the citizens.
We make our Eurorealism concrete by opting for a Europe that is strong where necessary and that places solidarity and responsibility at its centre.
Europe must be strong where necessary to deliver results that are tangible and concrete for citizens.
Today, the European Union is not sufficiently supported by the inhabitants of the Member States.
Only 31% of European citizens have a positive image of the EU.
However, European policy concerns everyone and should therefore not be conducted above the heads of the citizens.
If we want to create a sense of shared ownership, legislation and policy must be made and implemented as close to the citizen as possible.
We must therefore dare to ask ourselves whether everything the EU does is necessary and whether certain initiatives would not be better left to the Member States.
We are therefore opposing a European superstate, just as we are opposing a Flanders that withdraws into itself.
For the N-VA, the EU can take regulatory action if it is able to act more effectively than the Member States (subsidiarity principle).
Where cross-border cooperation clearly offers economies of scale, a European approach can be justified (for example in the areas of trade, competition and the monetary policy of the euro area).
Other powers belong at Member State, regional or local level because of the excessive costs of heterogeneity.
These are the costs of bringing together the sometimes divergent views of the Member States.
Work, investment policy, education, youth, sport, culture, language and tourism therefore do not belong at European level.
A Europe that is strong where necessary will be able to shape cooperation between countries and peoples and restore and strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union.
That is why the N-VA opts for a confederal Europe in which the member states decide together what they do together, not because they have to but because they want to.
Because it makes them better.
The Flemish are an open and supportive people.
They have proven this abundantly throughout their history and they continue to prove it every day.
However, solidarity is not an unconditional story.
Solidarity and responsibility, rights and duties are two sides of the same coin.
We are in favor of a Europe of solidarity,
but do not want to turn the EU into Belgium XL with unlimited transfers without any form of accountability.
For example, Member States that are struggling should be able to count on temporary solidarity in the form of financial support.
However, this solidarity must be objective, transparent and efficient.
It must also be accompanied by responsibility.
Today, the application of these criteria is problematic.
And as a result, the basis for solidarity is eroding.
Therefore, the Member States concerned must first and foremost take the necessary measures themselves to restore the confidence of the financial markets.
The free movement of citizens and workers within the EU is a principle that the N-VA strongly adheres to.
We recognise the existing problems with posted workers in certain sectors and emphasise that Member States and the EU must take responsibility to tackle fraud and social dumping vigorously and to enforce the rules correctly.
The fight against social fraud must be part of a multifaceted approach.
This is not only to the benefit of our companies, it also ensures that jobs are not unlawfully destroyed.
A supportive and responsible EU must above all be a project of shared ownership in which all citizens can participate so that cooperation can grow from the bottom up.
Safeguarding diversity, including linguistic diversity, within European identity is essential.
We share a European tradition characterised by a diversity of languages ​​and cultures.
This common element does not correspond to the idea of ​​a European superstate with only one uniform European culture.
That is why we uphold the fundamental right of every citizen to be able to communicate with the European institutions in his or her official language.
This also reduces the gap between the EU and its citizens.
3.3.1.2. Change for Progress
Bringing citizens and the EU closer together
Europe must be part of political decision-making at every level
. A European reflex must emerge among all decision-makers and policy makers.
The European debate must be more politicised by involving citizens more closely in the workings of the European Parliament.
This can be achieved mainly by increasing attention to European decision-making in the media and education.
We can also integrate the national (state and regional) and European levels more closely, for example by having national representatives act as a bridge, in interaction with the Members of the European Parliament.
The national parliaments (including the Flemish Parliament) must, following the example of Denmark, 'Europeanise'.
Before and after each meeting of the European Council or the Council of Ministers, the responsible minister must address Parliament to clarify the position.
For negotiations of the European Council or Council of Ministers on important topics, Parliament must give an explicit negotiating mandate.
For a more proactive assessment of European proposals, inspiration can be found in the Dutch government's BNC files (Assessment of New Commission Proposals).
In it, she gives an initial assessment of the European Commission's proposals, including in terms of competence, subsidiarity, proportionality and financial consequences.
The European Parliament must be given the right to initiate legislation for European powers.
This also applies to national and regional parliaments, which are given the right of initiative provided a certain quorum is reached.
This not only promotes the involvement of these parliaments in the European decision-making process, but also contributes to the democratisation of the European debate.
Correct application of the principle of subsidiarity
The Member States only transfer powers to the European Union if they all see added value in doing so.
In any case, legislation and policy must be made and implemented as close to the citizen as possible.
The subsidiarity test should be made more binding.
If a quorum of national and/or regional parliaments states that policy is better formulated at national or regional level than at European level, the European Commission must withdraw its proposal.
The ‘yellow and orange card’ procedures need to be improved.
Under these procedures, national Parliaments can send the Commission a reasoned opinion explaining why a particular draft European law is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity.
We provide better support to national parliaments to carry out this scrutiny task, with more time and resources, and with criteria they can use to justify their decision. honor transparency
Contacts between the EU and citizens' organisations, NGOs, companies, trade and professional organisations, trade unions, think tanks, etc. are useful and possible when they are fully transparent and within the limits of the law and ethical principles.
In this context, the mandatory nature of the transparency register must be tightened.
The scope of application should be extended to the other EU institutions and its functioning closely monitored.
Non-registered organisations should be excluded from conducting activities with the European institutions.
Support for deepening and internal expansion
The EU currently has 28 member states.
Since the previous rounds of external expansion have not yet been digested, further deepening must take place before any further expansion can be discussed.
The Copenhagen criteria are the starting point for the enlargement.
This includes having stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law and a functioning market economy.
Moreover, when welcoming new Member States, the EU must be able to maintain the dynamics of European cooperation.
The EU should pay more attention to internal expansion than to external enlargement.
The developments in stateless nations such as Scotland, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Flanders are natural processes.
This is an evolution, not a revolution.
The EU can no longer deny or avoid this peaceful state development.
Deciding otherwise would undermine the credibility of the millions of European citizens who opt for self-determination, democracy and European commitment.
Through internal enlargement, new states automatically become members of the European Union.
Moreover, this is essentially a political, not a legal, decision.
Of course, they must meet the membership requirements within a transitional period.
A structurally healthy economic base
The European economy needs stability.
This certainly applies to Flanders, which, with its open economy, is heavily dependent on international trade.
A well-functioning euro and a solid economic base are important, not least for social progress.
The Eurozone is a project based on solidarity but which also requires responsibility from its participating members.
Member States that are struggling must first and foremost take responsibility themselves and take the necessary measures to restore confidence in the financial markets.
It is very important that they make the necessary savings, reforms and investments.
This will enable them to reduce their government debt and increase their capacity to absorb any future shocks.
Because solidarity and responsibility go hand in hand, a country must have the option of leaving the eurozone without also leaving the Union.
Countries that do not comply with the obligations regarding sound finances and structural reforms should, in the worst case, even be forced to leave the eurozone.
Stronger economic governance with fiscal and banking union
Agreed rules must be applied effectively and strictly so as not to undermine mutual trust between Member States.
It is also important for the credibility of the EU itself to force Member States that do not adhere to the agreed rules to take responsibility.
Common debt financing, including in the form of Eurobonds, does not offer a sustainable solution.
On the contrary.
A debt level is simply added at a supranational level.
As a result, future generations will have to pay for today's unaffordable lifestyle.
This does not solve the problem.
European banking supervision is a clear example of the added value of a European approach.
A European banking union is necessary for a healthy monetary union.
It is important to ensure that surveillance is completely separate from monetary policy, as the latter's main objective is to maintain price stability.
Furthermore, Member States must be on an equal footing in the Supervisory Board within the European Central Bank (ECB).
A well-functioning European banking union presupposes, in addition to the supervisory function, a European resolution fund and deposit guarantee fund.
This European risk sharing should be the result of a step-by-step process, starting with well-functioning European banking supervision, followed by harmonised deposit guarantee schemes and resolution frameworks and a comparable financial starting position of the participating banks.
Only when these conditions are met can European risk sharing be considered.
Two additional conditions are important in this regard.
On the one hand, risk sharing can only relate to future costs and certainly not to costs from the past (‘legacy cost’).
On the other hand, all creditors must first be brought into the picture before the taxpayer has to foot the bill.
For deposit holders, this obviously only applies to amounts above the deposit guarantee.
Working towards more entrepreneurship, prosperity and jobs
The European Union must contribute to the prosperity on which well-being can be built.
Undoubtedly, the internal market is one of the EU's greatest assets.
The macroeconomic benefits of this market, which reaches more than 500 million citizens in the 28 Member States, are particularly significant.
The European internal market is also essential for Flanders, with its open and export-oriented economy.
Existing rules must first be properly converted and implemented before new ones can be created.
It is not the lack of rules, but the lack of transposition, implementation and enforcement of existing EU legislation that is a major stumbling block.
Less but better EU legislation is needed.
Administrative burdens are avoided and simplified as much as possible.
Correct application of rules is necessary to create a level playing field and to prevent unfair competition and social dumping.
We ensure that the general rule is that social security contributions are paid for all employees in accordance with the rules of the country where they work.
Further deepening of the internal market will create prosperity, growth and freedom of choice for both citizens and businesses.
Free movement, the implementation of the ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ (the stimulus plan for European networks, including transport) and correct implementation of the Services Directive are crucial in this respect.
For example, not all Member States yet have a website where foreign companies (and domestic entrepreneurs) can find all the information they need to offer services or set up a business in the Member State concerned.
More account should be taken of the impact of European legislation and its transposition on SMEs.
In addition, additional efforts should be made to make EU initiatives more accessible to SMEs.
A strong, competitive and sustainable industry in Europe is an absolute prerequisite for growth and prosperity, as well as stimulating entrepreneurship.
The proposals for a European industrial renaissance require careful monitoring.
Social Europe
The EU's robust economic foundation is the best guarantee for a more social and supportive Europe across generations.
The EU and the Member States must ensure that their ‘household/economy’ is in order.
We must introduce binding European social objectives and, for example, a poverty pact, with the Member States themselves determining how to achieve them.
For example, each (candidate) Member State must then reduce the poverty rate to a maximum to be determined per Member State: non-compliance will be subject to sanctions, in analogy with the Stability Pact.
However, it is not advisable to apply the classic recipe of European harmonisation to social security.
A uniform European minimum wage or a uniform retirement age would not support our European prosperity model.
After all, there is no economic basis capable of fulfilling the commitments made in the longer term without substantially undermining that basis itself.
In addition, there are different traditions regarding social security and reception in the various Member States.
Abuses and unfair competition must be dealt with severely.
That is why a clearer definition of the concept of posting is absolutely necessary for employees and employers,
as well as greater transparency and legal certainty, and better enforcement.
Effective control is essential to tackle abuse efficiently.
This is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.
Belgium is anything but a good student in this area.
Within the EU, national inspection services must cooperate better to tackle cross-border social dumping and fraud more quickly and efficiently.
3.3.2. World Flemish
3.3.2.1. Vision
Flanders must have the ambition to stand in the world as a strong and self-confident nation and state.
That is why Flanders must be given the space to conduct an independent, fully-fledged and professional Flemish foreign policy.
There must be a fully-fledged Flemish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with its own diplomatic service and a clear vision, mission and strategy.
Federal diplomacy, in turn, needs to be reformed.
Only in this way can Flanders defend its interests on the European and international stage and play its assets even better and more powerfully in a globalised world.
With regard to and within the European Union, Flanders' voice must be heard even more and better.
In order to have more influence on European decision-making, Flanders must sit at the negotiating table of European councils of ministers and working groups.
In the meantime, Flanders must be given more say in the preparation, determination and monitoring of European policy in Belgium.
For its part, the EU must take greater and better account of Belgium's internal institutional order and the autonomy of the regions.
The EU also needs an effective foreign policy.
The N-VA therefore advocates a strong Europe in the world, which makes every effort to promote common strategic interests and the prosperity and protection of its citizens.
3.3.2.2. Change for Progress
An autonomous and comprehensive Flemish foreign policy
We are establishing a fully-fledged Flemish Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a clear vision, mission and strategy.
It is responsible for the development of an independent, mature and professional Flemish foreign policy.
In order to fully promote its own political and economic interests abroad, Flanders has a single diplomatic service, in which we bring together the currently fragmented services (Representatives of the Flemish Government, Flemish Agency for International Enterprise, Flemish Agency for International Cooperation and Tourism Flanders).
We also physically bring these services together as much as possible in one workplace.
This will strengthen mutual cooperation and coordination.
We set up action programmes that include the current assignments of FIT, the Enterprise Agency and the technology attachés.
Flanders' diplomatic representatives will be given full status.
First and foremost, they must support our people and companies abroad and put Flanders on the international map.
In contrast to the party-political appointment carousel of federal diplomacy, we select Flemish diplomats objectively on the basis of knowledge, experience and language skills.
The diplomatic representatives act with complete independence and objectivity and are not affiliated with ministers or ministerial cabinets.
They serve the entire Flemish government and systematically keep the entire government informed of political and other developments in their area of ​​responsibility.
In a globalized world, Flanders needs antennas in new emerging countries
. The BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey) are interesting options.
We are strengthening representation at the EU and international organisations.
Due to the increasing importance of international organisations, the Flemish diplomatic representative to international organisations in Geneva will be given a permanent workplace.
We are developing an integrated strategy for economic, academic, cultural and public diplomacy of the Flemish government.
In this way, foreign policy can be more than the traditional ‘political’ diplomacy from minister to minister and we strengthen the ties between foreign policy, economy/trade, development cooperation, culture and education.
We strengthen ties with like-minded regions and countries with common interests.
Flanders draws up strategy notes that specify bilateral cooperation with a partner country and fit into a clear vision.
We prioritize cooperation with the Netherlands
and continue to pay attention to other neighbouring countries (including in the context of interregional cooperation within the European Structural and Investment Funds).
We will continue Flanders' contribution to the functioning of the Benelux, including increased involvement in the Belgian position.
Flanders takes targeted initiatives to make its policy known and legitimise it with regard to the media, opinion makers and the general public.
We use the presence of European officials, diplomats and foreign journalists in Brussels to play our trump cards.
The Flemish-European Liaison Agency will receive further support.
In this way, the bridge between Europe, Flemish (local) authorities and civil society is strengthened.
and the Flemish government services and civil society will have even better access to European policy through information platforms and networking.
Flanders reports directly to Europe as much as possible (without passing through the Belgian post box).
Conversely, we ask Europe to forward as much information as possible directly to Flanders.
It is important for both parties to be able to inform and be informed quickly and accurately.
The Minister-President of the Flemish Government must be able to participate directly in the European Council.
In addition, the Flemish permanent representative to the EU must be a structural member of the Belgian delegation in the European Council and the Councils of Ministers.
Flanders is stepping up its efforts to ensure a more timely and correct transposition of European regulations.
We update the roadmap for the transposition of European regulations and complete treaty procedures quickly and correctly, with respect for the powers and role of the Flemish Parliament.
In specific files concerning arms trade, the Flemish government strives, according to the arms decree, for a healthy balance between promoting peace and security and our own industrial interests.
There is sufficient exchange of information about end use between companies and the government.
We are terminating the cooperation agreement for the Foreign Trade Agency.
FIT, which is responsible for trade policy at Flemish level, will take over the relevant tasks.
We actively involve Flemish people living abroad in Flemish foreign policy.
The association 'Flemish in the World' is a priority partner in this regard.
In an increasingly globalised world, it is important that children of Flemish people who live abroad for a certain period of time can receive quality Dutch-language education.
This way, they can easily integrate into Flemish society when they return to Flanders.
Maximum cooperation with the Netherlands is advisable in this regard.
A serviceable federal diplomacy
Federal diplomacy serves the states, not as a meddling mother-in-law, but as a partner.
We take measures to ensure that services are guaranteed in Dutch.
It is unacceptable that Flemish people should have to rely on a government service that does not speak their native language.
We select and send diplomats based on competencies and appropriate skills such as language skills, not because they have the ‘right party card’.
We put a stop to the political carousel.
Before ambassadors leave for abroad, there is a hearing in the House of Representatives, following the European model.
In this way, members of parliament can learn about their expertise, qualities and experience in an open debate.
Only this openness can break through politicization.
We are abolishing the federal economic advisers: not only is this a competence of the states,
it is an unnecessary waste of human effort and resources.
A strong Flemish voice on European forums
We are properly adapting the cooperation agreements regarding coordination and representation in the EU, international organisations and the representatives of Flanders, so that the member states can sit at the table as full partners.
We tailor the rotation scheme to the economic and demographic weight of Flanders in Belgium.
This means that Flanders must be given its own place at the European negotiating table for more domains than is currently the case, compared to the other regions.
This also means that the categories of the European Councils of Ministers will be adapted to the recent state reforms and will be fully extended to informal councils, working groups and all kinds of meetings.
Since Belgium remains liable to the EU for the obligations of the regions, the federal government and the regions must make clear agreements on the division of liability (for example, a fine imposed by the EU).
It cannot be the intention that one government should be held responsible for the failure of another government to fulfil its obligations.
A strong European foreign policy
Crucial for a strong and effective European foreign policy are: a more effective performance of the European External Action Service (EEAS),
actively promote multilateralism,
defining more common objectives and investing in strategic partnerships.
After all, a safe and stable environment is a prerequisite for maintaining social and economic stability in the EU.
We support the development of a genuine European diplomacy.
Where possible and necessary, Belgian diplomacy can use its energy to help shape European diplomacy, rather than playing cavalier seulement (for example when it concerns Congo).
To achieve an effective European foreign policy, more decisions should be taken by qualified majority.
It goes without saying that Member States must always be able to decide autonomously whether to participate in military interventions.
The common European trade policy offers the best opportunities for open trade and a level playing field.
The EU should deepen trade ties with regional and individual partners (e.g. Japan, the ASEAN region, Mercosur and the US), ideally through a proactive role within the multilateral trading system of the World Trade Organisation.
The EU must ensure that unfair trading practices by third countries do not harm healthy, competitive European companies.
Trade defence instruments must be applied consistently to tackle dumping practices on the European market and subsidies that are not in line with international trade rules.
The promotion and safeguard of human rights and fundamental freedoms must remain cornerstones of the EU's international action.
A fair balance between ensuring security and the fundamental rights of EU citizens that we consider vital in Europe must always be observed.
The EU should express its strong support for international institutions specifically established to combat impunity, in particular the International Criminal Court.
3.3.3. Smart development cooperation
3.3.3.1. Vision
Solidarity with peoples and countries in the form of development cooperation should not be a matter of treating symptoms, but should aim to structurally lift people in the South out of poverty.
The ultimate goal is self-reliance.
Smart development cooperation places responsibility on developing countries.
In time, they will have the necessary resources to determine and maintain their own future.
This is only possible when the backbone of their society is strengthened, through the development of well-functioning and democratic institutions with legal certainty and respect for the rule of law,
through sustainable growth – with respect for the economic, social and ecological aspects –
and through international trade.
The stringent budgetary framework forces us to make clear choices in our development policy.
Especially in times of budgetary difficulties, it is necessary to deploy resources in the most efficient way.
Rather than fragmenting resources across a multitude of themes and partner countries, we opt for a concentration policy.
Such a policy is based on the strengths of the Flemish project partners.
3.3.3.2. Change for Progress
Broader and stronger support base
Development cooperation is not just a matter for the government or NGOs, but also and above all a matter for people and people.
That is why Flanders is continuing to work on a policy that contributes to increasing the involvement of the population.
In order to maintain and increase support among citizens/taxpayers, development cooperation must be carried out in a transparent manner.
This implies, among other things, that we view the input as well as the output of our programs and projects in a results-oriented manner.
We test project-based collaboration against clear results and relevant socio-economic impact.
We aim to spend 0.7 percent of gross domestic product on development cooperation.
In pursuing this objective, each pillar has a role to play: governments, international organisations, private organisations, NGOs and partnerships.
We avoid fragmentation of resources.
Small-scale, personal projects (the so-called fourth pillar) play an important role.
Municipal policy, facilitated by the Flemish government, can make a difference here.
Thematic and geographical concentration
In our development cooperation we achieve maximum geographical and thematic concentration by focusing on a limited number of partner countries and a limited number of policy themes.
We give priority to sectors in which we have strong expertise.
We also demonstrate that we are a reliable and expert partner for development cooperation.
Three sectors run like a common thread through our collaboration: entrepreneurship, education and sexual and reproductive health care.
These are the basic requirements to strengthen the backbone of a society by breaking the cycle of backwardness and poverty.
We develop strategy notes with a limited number of partners, who are selected on the basis of objective criteria.
In international cooperation projects, we give priority to Flemish project partners such as associations, knowledge institutions and companies.
Tied aid is possible if it is based on the strengths and comparative advantages of the Flemish partners themselves and if it also benefits the partner countries themselves.
The European Union has an important complementary role in our development policy.
The promotion of sustainable development, in the broad sense of the word, must be a priority objective of its policy towards developing countries.
Ownership and good governance
Because developing countries must ultimately take responsibility themselves, we focus on the principle of ownership in our collaboration with partner governments.
The goal should be self-reliance, not subsidy dependency.
The condition is of course that the partners have functioning institutions that can implement the collaboration.
Authorities with which Flanders cooperates must unequivocally respect human rights
and respect basic democratic values.
We therefore attach conditions to the cooperation and take action when partner countries do not adhere to the agreements.
As a last resort, a decision may be made to partially or completely suspend aid through an exit strategy.
We also link development cooperation to cooperation on migration policy (return of rejected asylum seekers)
and in matters of justice (readmission of prisoners who do not have the right to reside with us).
We are further expanding Flemish development cooperation.
Pending the establishment of the Belgian Confederation, we are splitting the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) and the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO) and investigating how Flanders can fulfil their tasks effectively.
At an annual Flemish States-General for Development Cooperation, we bring together both domestic and foreign partners to design joint projects, exchange ideas and network.
