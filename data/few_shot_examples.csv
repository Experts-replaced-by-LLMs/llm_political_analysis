decentralization,Decentralization_Score_4_MikPartyB.txt,4,"The manifesto sees both costs and benefits in the decentralization of power and decision making to local and regional authorities.
The main benefit are that it is better, other things being equal, to get decision making as close as possible to individual citizens, so the decision makers can respond to local needs, and local people can feel more a part of the decision making process. Every local area is not the same, so decision making and administration needs to be in the hands of people who best know what is needed in a particular area.
On the other hand, local administrators may be less competent and well-trained than national civil servants, and potentially more open to corruption by local business interests. 
It is also inefficient to repeat the same decision making analysis, time and time again, in every local area.
The party therefore advocates a balance between delegating certain decisions to local politicians and administrators where these are intrinsically local, for example land use planning, but reserving to national governments decision making on matters such as taxation, and the funding and delivery of major public services.
"
decentralization,Decentralization_Score_7 MikPartyA.txt,7,"The manifesto does not support the decentralization of decision making and administration to local regions.
Local and regional politicians and administrators are seen as more likely to be corrupt and inefficient, and more poorly trained, than those elected to national governments or recruited to the national civil service.
Major policy decisions need to be supported by the highest quality research and analysis, which is best carried out at a national level. It is wasteful and inefficient to repeat such analyses, more poorly resourced, in every local region.
Recognizing that local people need access to decision makers and the decision making process, the best way to achieve this is by creating incentives for elected member of parliament to be more open to input from voters, and by exploiting new technology to improve the quality of interactions between citizens and decision-makers.
The manifesto argues that, since most taxes are paid by people to their national government, there is no justification for local variations in the quality of public services they receive in exchange for this.
