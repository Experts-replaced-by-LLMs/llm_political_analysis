The manifesto outlines a comprehensive vision for the country's role and participation in the European Union (EU), emphasizing the need for active and constructive engagement. It criticizes the current government's approach, which it claims has led to marginalization within the EU, reducing the country's influence and effectiveness in European affairs. 

The manifesto advocates re-establishing close cooperation with major EU countries, particularly Germany and France. It envisions the country acting as a bridge between larger and smaller EU states, as well as between Western and Central Europe. The goal is to be seen as a credible and reliable partner within the EU.

The manifesto supports deeper economic integration within the EU, including participation in initiatives like the European Defence Fund and the European Agency for Defence. It also seeks increased support for businesses and exports through enhanced diplomatic and economic cooperation within the EU framework.

The manifesto underscores the importance of adhering to EU principles of rule of law and democracy. It criticizes the current government's actions that have allegedly undermined these principles and pledges to restore judicial independence and media freedom in line with EU standards.

In summary, the manifesto presents a vision of the country as a committed and influential member of the EU. It advocates for policies that enhance the country's role in European integration, secure financial and strategic benefits, and uphold democratic values and the rule of law.
