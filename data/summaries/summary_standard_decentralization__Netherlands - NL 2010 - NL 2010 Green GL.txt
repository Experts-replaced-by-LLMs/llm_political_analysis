**Summary of the Political Manifesto (GroenLinks)**

**Decentralization:**

- **General Stance:**
  - GroenLinks advocates for a balanced approach to decentralization, emphasizing the need for both regional self-governance and national coherence.
  - The party supports granting more legislative, fiscal, and administrative autonomy to regional and local governments.

- **Municipal Empowerment:**
  - Municipalities are to receive additional funds to expand home care and small-scale neighborhood facilities, such as day care for elderly with dementia.
  - Municipalities will be responsible for organizing youth care, including home-based parenting support and specialized youth workers.
  - Municipalities are tasked with supporting broad participation and are given extra earmarked funds to organize small-scale neighborhood facilities.

- **Provincial and Regional Governance:**
  - Some provincial responsibilities, such as culture and youth care, will be transferred to municipalities.
  - Provinces and water boards will be merged into a powerful middle-level government with significant authority over spatial planning, traffic, transportation, nature, and water management.
  - The number of non-democratically legitimized regional organizations will be significantly reduced, with tasks transferred to the newly formed regional governments or municipalities.

- **Healthcare Decentralization:**
  - Health insurers will play a larger role in the execution of public care, operating without profit motives and in collaboration with municipalities to establish neighborhood care facilities.
  - The long-term care (AWBZ) will be largely transferred to the public basic insurance, with insurers required to work with municipalities to enable people to live at home longer.

- **Education and Social Services:**
  - Schools are mandated to provide healthy canteens and sufficient sports opportunities for students.
  - Municipalities will actively involve citizens in policy-making through citizen panels and neighborhood budgets, and directly involve them in policy evaluation through user groups and quality panels.

- **Public Sector Reform:**
  - The public sector will be streamlined by merging existing ministries into eight departments, reducing management layers, and forming a more efficient and democratically legitimized middle-level government.
  - The number of independent administrative bodies will be reduced, and the use of expensive external consultants by governments will be curtailed.

- **Citizen Participation:**
  - Citizens will have more influence over their lives through neighborhood budgets, client and resident councils, and stronger positions for elected representatives in enterprise and participation councils.
  - The government will support citizen initiatives and reduce bureaucratic obstacles to encourage active participation in a democratic society.

- **Fiscal Policies:**
  - The tax system will be reformed to be greener, with increased taxes on environmental pollution and wealth, and reduced taxes on labor.
  - The government will ensure that the strongest shoulders bear the heaviest burdens, promoting solidarity between generations and supporting those in vulnerable positions.

In summary, GroenLinks promotes a decentralized approach to governance, empowering municipalities and regional governments with more autonomy and resources while ensuring national coherence. The party emphasizes the importance of citizen participation, efficient public sector management, and a balanced fiscal policy that supports environmental sustainability and social equity.
