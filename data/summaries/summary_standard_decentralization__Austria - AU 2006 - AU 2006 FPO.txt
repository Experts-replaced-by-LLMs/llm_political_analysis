**Summary of the FPÖ Political Manifesto for the 2006 National Council Election**

**Decentralization:**
- **Strong Centralization Stance:**
  - The FPÖ manifesto does not explicitly address decentralization in terms of legislative, fiscal, or administrative autonomy for regional and local governments.
  - The party emphasizes national coherence and central control, particularly in areas such as immigration, security, and public services.
  - Policies suggest a preference for centralized decision-making, especially in managing immigration, asylum, and public safety.
  - The manifesto calls for the federal government to maintain control over essential services like water supply and public safety, rejecting EU-driven liberalization efforts.
  - The FPÖ supports the centralization of asylum procedures and the establishment of a federal body to manage the return of foreigners.
  - The party's approach to federalism is not explicitly detailed, but the emphasis on national policies and central control indicates a preference for a strong central government.
