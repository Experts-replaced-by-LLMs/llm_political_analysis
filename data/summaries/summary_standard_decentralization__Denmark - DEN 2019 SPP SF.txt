The text is in Danish. Here is a summary of the political manifesto focusing on the key points and policy positions related to decentralization:

**Decentralization:**

- **Strengthening Local Governance:**
  - SF (Socialist People's Party) emphasizes the importance of local governance and the need for municipalities to have more autonomy and resources to address local issues effectively.
  - They propose the establishment of local welfare centers and better support for local initiatives, particularly in rural areas.
  - The party advocates for a more significant role for municipalities in implementing environmental policies, such as the Green Denmark Map, which aims to connect and develop new natural areas.

- **Fiscal Decentralization:**
  - SF supports the idea of shared municipal taxes, where tax-paying individuals contribute to the municipalities where they own a permanent residence. This aims to balance the economic disparities between different regions.
  - They propose better loan opportunities in peripheral areas through the creation of a special mortgage institution to support local development.

- **Administrative Decentralization:**
  - The party calls for the decentralization of certain administrative functions from the state to municipalities, such as handling name changes and issuing birth certificates, to streamline processes and make them more accessible to citizens.
  - SF suggests that local authorities should have more control over public services, including health and education, to tailor them to the specific needs of their communities.

- **Regional Development:**
  - SF emphasizes the need for a balanced development between urban and rural areas. They propose measures to support land districts, such as better broadband access, support for micro-enterprises, and the establishment of educational satellites in peripheral areas.
  - They advocate for a travel team to advise on local potential and better support for the demolition of dilapidated houses in rural districts.

- **Public Participation and Local Influence:**
  - The party aims to enhance public participation in decision-making processes, ensuring that citizens have a greater say in local governance.
  - They propose reforms to give public employees more freedom to perform their duties and provide citizens with greater local influence and self-management.

- **Environmental and Technological Decentralization:**
  - SF supports the decentralization of environmental initiatives, encouraging local governments to take the lead in implementing green solutions and sustainable practices.
  - They advocate for the promotion of local energy solutions, such as district heating and electric pumps, to reduce reliance on centralized fossil fuel-based energy sources.

- **Education and Social Services:**
  - The party calls for more localized control over educational and social services, ensuring that these services are adapted to the needs of local communities.
  - They propose the introduction of practical project assignments and practical-musical subjects in schools to make students more curious about vocational education.

- **Healthcare:**
  - SF suggests that local health houses and social nurses should be established to alleviate the burden on general practitioners, especially in underserved areas.
  - They propose the creation of diagnostic centers in hospitals to ensure prompt and effective treatment for elderly and medical patients.

Overall, SF's manifesto strongly supports decentralization, advocating for increased legislative, fiscal, and administrative autonomy for regional and local governments. They emphasize the balance between regional self-governance and national coherence, aiming to empower local authorities to address specific community needs while maintaining a unified national framework.
