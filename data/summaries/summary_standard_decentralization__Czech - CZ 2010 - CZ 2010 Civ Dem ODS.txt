  - Proposes increasing financial autonomy for municipalities, allowing greater control over budgets and spending.
  - Highlights the importance of local governments in managing regional development projects and infrastructure investments, focusing on effective use of EU funds.

- **Balance Between Regional and National Coherence:**
  - Emphasizes the need for national coherence in policy-making, especially in fiscal policy, social security, and healthcare.
  - Proposes a balanced approach where local governments can address regional needs while adhering to national standards.
  - Suggests that decentralization should lead to more efficient and responsive governance, not fragmentation.
