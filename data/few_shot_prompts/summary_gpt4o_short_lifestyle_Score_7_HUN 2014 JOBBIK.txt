The manifesto's emphasis on traditional family values and the protection of life suggests a preference for policies that encourage childbirth and family growth. The party proposes a societal program to investigate the reasons behind Hungary's high abortion rates, aiming to prevent and reduce the number of abortions. They seek to support and assist mothers and expectant mothers to ensure they have the necessary resources to carry their pregnancies to term.

The manifesto opposes same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples, advocating policies that align with traditional heterosexual family structures. The manifesto acknowledges the existence of individuals with homosexual tendencies and opposes discrimination against them but criticizes the promotion of homosexuality as a "trendy" phenomenon. This reflects a conservative approach, emphasizing tolerance without endorsement.

The manifesto strongly supports traditional social values, particularly focusing on the family unit as the cornerstone of society. It defines a family as a life partnership between a man and a woman, established by mutual consent, and includes their children. The party aims to protect the family from what it perceives as liberal attacks promoting alternative lifestyles and non-traditional family structures.

The manifesto criticizes the influence of globalist and liberal ideologies, advocating a return to national and Christian roots. 

Overall, the manifesto reflects the party's commitment to upholding traditional social values, supporting families, and addressing social issues through a conservative lens. The party's approach to social policies is deeply rooted in its nationalistic and traditionalist ideology.
