The manifesto outlines a comprehensive and structured approach to immigration and border control under the principle of "Integration before Immigration." 

The manifesto emphasizes that the integration of existing immigrants should be prioritized before allowing new immigrants. 

It calls for increased efforts to improve living conditions in refugees' home regions to prevent forced migration, implementing a European "Marshall Plan" for Africa to effectively address the root causes of migration, and intensifying efforts to negotiate repatriation agreements for rejected asylum seekers

It argues for the creation of a unified European asylum system with standardized procedures and fair distribution of asylum seekers across member states. Setting up European processing centers at the EU's external borders to expedite asylum procedures. Developing processing centers outside the EU under to prevent dangerous sea crossings and dismantle human smuggling networks.

It asserts that illegal migration must be reduced to zero, while those granted asylum should be fully integrated into society, including an integration year for asylum recipients to facilitate language acquisition and job market preparation.

In summary, the manifesto advocates for a balanced and responsible approach to immigration, emphasizing integration, international cooperation, and legal pathways while ensuring robust border control and addressing the root causes of migration.
