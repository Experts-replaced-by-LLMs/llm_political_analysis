The manifesto does not support the decentralization of decision making and administration to local regions.
Local and regional politicians and administrators are seen as more likely to be corrupt and inefficient, and more poorly trained, than those elected to national governments or recruited to the national civil service.
Major policy decisions need to be supported by the highest quality research and analysis, which is best carried out at a national level. It is wasteful and inefficient to repeat such analyses, more poorly resourced, in every local region.
Recognizing that local people need access to decision makers and the decision making process, the best way to achieve this is by creating incentives for elected member of parliament to be more open to input from voters, and by exploiting new technology to improve the quality of interactions between citizens and decision-makers.
The manifesto argues that, since most taxes are paid by people to their national government, there is no justification for local variations in the quality of public services they receive in exchange for this.
