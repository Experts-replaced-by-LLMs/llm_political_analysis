**Summary of the FPÖ Political Manifesto (2006) on Immigration Policies**

**Immigration:**
- **General Stance:**
  - The FPÖ advocates for a complete halt to immigration, emphasizing that Austria is not an immigration country and this should be enshrined in the Federal Constitution.
  - Establishment of a dedicated State Secretariat to manage the repatriation of foreigners.
  - Introduction of a new administrative offense for "refusal to adapt" to Austrian norms.

- **Employment and Residency:**
  - Work permits for foreigners are to be issued only temporarily and strictly when there is a significant and unresolvable shortage of labor in specific sectors.
  - Guest workers will lose their residence permits if they are unemployed for extended periods or repeatedly, to prevent them from becoming a burden on the social state.
  - Immediate deportation of foreigners found working illegally, following the revocation of their residence and work permits.

- **Social Security and Benefits:**
  - Creation of a separate social insurance system for guest workers, designed specifically for temporary stays in Austria, with no public funding to cover deficits.
  - Non-EU citizens are not entitled to social assistance or emergency aid during their first three years of residence.
  - Social security abuse by foreigners is to be criminalized and punished with deportation.

- **Legal and Citizenship Measures:**
  - Mandatory visa requirements for all non-EU foreigners, with exceptions for Switzerland and Norway.
  - Revocation of special rights for Turkish citizens.
  - Citizenship grants must be retrospectively reviewed, with fraudulent citizenships being revoked.
  - Citizenship can also be revoked for insufficient adaptation (e.g., lack of language skills or knowledge of the country).
  - Foreigners convicted of crimes are to be stripped of their Austrian citizenship and deported.
  - Political activities are strictly tied to citizenship, with violators losing their residence permits.

- **Language and Integration:**
  - German is the official language, and all necessary translations and interpreters for official matters must be financed by the foreigner.
  - Public schools must ensure state involvement in the selection of religious teachers to prevent radical Islamist influence.

- **Asylum Policies:**
  - Asylum procedures should not be outsourced to private companies but managed by the federal government.
  - The burden of proof in asylum cases lies with the applicant, with unclear cases resulting in detention.
  - False information in asylum applications leads to immediate deportation.
  - Asylum seekers without documents (Sans Papiers) and illegal immigrants are to be returned to the country from which they entered Austria.
  - Biometric identification measures for asylum seekers should be implemented EU-wide.
  - Asylum seekers are to be housed in separate, remote facilities until their cases are resolved, with no access to the labor market.
  - Criminal asylum seekers are to be expelled immediately without the possibility of appeal.
  - The asylum ground of "traumatization" is to be abolished.
  - Asylum applications from safe third countries are to be rejected.
  - Refugees from regions recognizing the Geneva Refugee Convention (GFK) are to be returned immediately.
  - Development aid is to be conditional on the cooperation of states in the asylum process, including the acceptance of their nationals who are denied asylum or convicted of crimes in Europe.

- **Family Reunification:**
  - No legal entitlement to family reunification.
  - Extension of transitional periods to protect the Austrian labor market until wage levels in new EU member states align with those in Austria.

- **Security Measures:**
  - Establishment of a foreign police force modeled after Switzerland, focusing on foreigner-related issues, including crime.
  - This unit should have special competencies, language skills, and be networked with other departments.

This summary captures the FPÖ's restrictive stance on immigration, emphasizing stringent control measures, limited social benefits, and rigorous integration and security policies.
