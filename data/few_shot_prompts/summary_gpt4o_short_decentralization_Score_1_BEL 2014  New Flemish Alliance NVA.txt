The manifesto advocates significant restructuring of the political system towards a more decentralized model, where regions hold primary authority over most governance matters, with the federal level retaining only those powers that the regions agree to share.

The manifesto argues that a centralized federal system is inefficient and calls for the decentralization of administrative functions to enhance efficiency and responsiveness. It suggests that local governments should have more autonomy and resources to better serve their communities. This includes transferring federal responsibilities to regional and local levels, thereby reducing bureaucratic overhead and improving service delivery.

The manifesto aims to resolve the inefficiencies and conflicts inherent in the federal system by granting more power and responsibility to regional and local governments, fostering a more responsive and effective governance structure. It underscores the importance of decentralization, regional empowerment, and the principle of subsidiarity.
