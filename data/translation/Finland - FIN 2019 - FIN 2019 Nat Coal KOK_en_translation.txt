The parliamentary election program of the Coalition 2019
We trust Finland
We Finns are the most reliable people in the world.
We have always done our job and managed, even in difficult places.
We have all the conditions to continue Finland's success story even better than before.
Together we can do even better.
The Congress has a clear vision of what kind of successful Finland it is, and what needs to be done to achieve success.
We trust Finland.
And we trust the Finns.
Finns deserve more hope and faith in the future.
Our well-being will increase as long as we free Finns to do and realize themselves.
The goal of the coalition is a Finland where everyone can develop themselves, get excited and succeed, and participate according to their abilities.
You can also fail and need help, then we will help you.
"A fair society offers everyone the tools to build a good life."
The goal of the coalition is a Finland where regulation is not an obstacle to activity.
A country where it is safe to live and work.
A stable society where the economy is managed responsibly.
Got to do -In Finland, working life is being reformed in a more flexible and equal direction than it is now.
Both those working and those looking for work have the opportunity to update their skills.
More and more matters of working life are agreed upon where things are best known, i.e. at workplaces.
The ambitious family leave reform will especially improve the position of women in the labor market.
In the future, you can flexibly combine work with studying or starting a business and with your own family situation.
Even those outside the working life have opportunities to do and participate.
For us, taxation is a tool that enables people's well-being and the wheels of society to run.
Taxes are people's money, and we want to share only what is necessary.
This is how we encourage you to do more.
Instead of work and effort, we tax more emissions and harm.
We use taxation to combat climate change.
A fair society offers everyone the tools to build a good life.
It is equality of opportunity.
Everyone can also trust that in a difficult place, society and safety nets will support and help them get back on their feet.
Social security is being reformed to encourage action, activity and self-development.
So that doing the work is always worth it.
Finland is open, international and safe.
A country that makes sustainable solutions for the environment, climate and security both nationally and together with others in Europe and the world.
In a Finland like this, everyone can trust that they will be fine.

and debt under control.
You have to be able to trust Finland, and we want to stick to this in the future as well.

At the same time, it is "You can do" Finland, where everyone can be themselves, pursue their ideals, learn new things, work and try.
A country where success is neither envied nor hindered.
But also a country where you can count on getting help when you get into trouble.
In Finland, everyone is heard and taken into account.
To be accepted as oneself, with strengths and weaknesses.
That kind of Finland is the best country in the world.
