**Summary of Political Manifesto (Dutch to English)**

**Decentralization:**

- **Reduction of Government Layers:**
  - Proposes a radical reduction in the density of governance at all levels, suggesting that at least a quarter of the current administrative layers can be eliminated.
  - Advocates for reducing the number of seats in the House of Representatives from 150 to 100 and in the Senate from 75 to 50 to focus debates on major issues.

- **Provincial and Municipal Reforms:**
  - Suggests the abolition of the four provinces (North Holland, South Holland, Utrecht, and Flevoland) and their replacement with a single Randstad province to streamline governance in the densely populated region.
  - Calls for the elimination of the 'stadsdeelraden' (district councils) to simplify local governance.

- **Empowerment of Local Governments:**
  - Emphasizes that municipalities should have more autonomy to make their own decisions, particularly in areas close to the citizens.
  - Proposes that provincial responsibilities be limited to spatial planning, traffic, and environmental issues, removing their involvement in education, integration, and care for the elderly and youth.

- **Elected Mayors:**
  - Advocates for the direct election of mayors by local voters, to be enshrined in the Constitution, enhancing local democratic accountability.

- **Administrative Efficiency:**
  - Calls for a significant reduction in internal controls and bureaucratic procedures within government organizations, aiming to cut down on management and administrative costs.
  - Suggests that all public organizations funded by taxes or premiums should adhere to a strict bureaucratic norm, limiting management and administrative costs to a maximum of 15%.

- **National vs. Local Responsibilities:**
  - Stresses that certain issues, such as combating terrorism and serious crime, require a national approach, while local police and governance should contribute to these national goals.
  - Proposes the establishment of a Minister of Security to oversee national security policies, including police, intelligence, terrorism, border control, crisis management, and public prosecution.

- **Public Service and Accountability:**
  - Emphasizes that public responsibilities and tasks should be clearly defined and not privatized unless on a contractual basis.
  - Advocates for the use of information and communication technology to improve public service delivery and efficiency, ensuring that citizens only need to provide their information once.

- **Simplification of Regulations:**
  - Calls for the abolition of unnecessary regulations and permits, advocating for a shift from pre-approval to post-production control to foster trust and reduce bureaucratic overhead.
  - Proposes the elimination of the 'welstandscommissies' (aesthetic committees) and detailed building regulations, except for monumental buildings and protected city and village views.

- **Fiscal Policies:**
  - Suggests lowering income tax rates by 3% across all brackets to increase net income for nearly all Dutch citizens.
  - Proposes the abolition of inheritance tax and a significant reduction in gift tax, arguing that these taxes are unfair as the money has already been taxed once.
