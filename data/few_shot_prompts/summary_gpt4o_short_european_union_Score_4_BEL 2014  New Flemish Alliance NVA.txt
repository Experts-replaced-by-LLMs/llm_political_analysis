The manifesto emphasizes the importance of balancing responsibility with solidarity within the EU framework. It argues that member states facing financial difficulties should take their own measures to restore market confidence, rather than relying excessively on EU support. It calls for robust action against fraud and social dumping, emphasizing that both member states and the EU must enforce rules correctly.

The manifesto stresses the importance of preserving diversity, including linguistic diversity, within the European identity, opposing the idea of a uniform European superstate. 

It calls for bringing the EU closer to its citizens by integrating European decision-making at all levels and increasing the politicization of the European debate. .

The party insists on a correct application of the subsidiarity principle, where powers are only transferred to the EU if all member states see added value and allowing national and regional parliaments to compel the European Commission to withdraw proposals if a quorum believes the policy is better handled at the national or regional level.

The party believes that before considering further enlargement, the EU should focus on deepening integration. 

It stresses the need for a stable European economy, supporting a well-functioning euro and solid economic foundations, and arguing for member states to take responsibility for their own financial health.
