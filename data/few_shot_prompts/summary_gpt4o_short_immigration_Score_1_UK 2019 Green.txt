The manifesto outlines a comprehensive and humane approach to immigration and border control, emphasizing social justice, human rights, and international cooperation.

The party proposes replacing a new ministry which would enforce migration rules with compassion and respect for human rights, moving away from the current hostile environment. 

The manifesto advocates for a reformed European refugee policy centered on humanity and compassion. It supports the re-establishment of a European sea-rescue mission to save lives in danger in European waters and calls for an urgent review of the safety of all migrants traveling to and across Europe.

The party is committed to enshrining Freedom of Movement as a core principle, allowing people to live, learn, and love without borders.

The manifesto calls for the immediate closure of immigration detention centers, which are criticized for their culture of abuse and violence. All deportation flights would be suspended immediately, allowing refugees to live freely and work while their applications are being processed.

Migrants would be guaranteed safe and discreet access to public services like police, health, and education without fear of immigration enforcement.

The manifesto defends the right of people of all faiths to express their beliefs, including through religious clothing, food, and observance, and commits to working with religious communities to ensure the safety of places of worship.
