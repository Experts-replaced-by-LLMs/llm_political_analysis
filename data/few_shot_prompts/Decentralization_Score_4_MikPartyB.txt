The manifesto sees both costs and benefits in the decentralization of power and decision making to local and regional authorities.
The main benefit are that it is better, other things being equal, to get decision making as close as possible to individual citizens, so the decision makers can respond to local needs, and local people can feel more a part of the decision making process. Every local area is not the same, so decision making and administration needs to be in the hands of people who best know what is needed in a particular area.
On the other hand, local administrators may be less competent and well-trained than national civil servants, and potentially more open to corruption by local business interests. 
It is also inefficient to repeat the same decision making analysis, time and time again, in every local area.
The party therefore advocates a balance between delegating certain decisions to local politicians and administrators where these are intrinsically local, for example land use planning, but reserving to national governments decision making on matters such as taxation, and the funding and delivery of major public services.
