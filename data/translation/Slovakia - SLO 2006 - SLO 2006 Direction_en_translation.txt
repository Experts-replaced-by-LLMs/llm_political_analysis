TOWARDS THE PEOPLE
DIRECTION - social democracy
"Only the model of the welfare state, within the framework of economic growth, can give the weak and threatened citizens of the Slovak Republic the prospect of a decent and dignified life and the entire society the possibility of a faster approach to the standard of living of the developed countries of the European Union.
Never before have the principles of the welfare state in Slovakia been weakened as they are now.
Never before has Slovakia needed a return to basic social security and the introduction of the European social model as urgently as today.
It is a return to human dignity."
From the program document SMERU - social democracy "Return to human dignity" adopted in December 2005
BASIC STARTING POINTS AND OBJECTIVES
SMER - social democracy is an internationally recognized center-left political party.
He is a full member of the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists.
SMER - social democracy wants to fulfill the values ​​of solidarity, justice and equal opportunities with its practical policy in the case of participation in the government formed on the basis of the results of the elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic on June 17, 2006.
Intergenerational solidarity, solidarity between the rich and the poor, and solidarity between lagging and developed regions is the key to a society with a decent quality of life for the widest possible strata of the population.
SMER - social democracy represents a clear political, economic and social alternative to the current right-wing government.
This alternative is based on Article 55 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, according to which the economy of the Slovak Republic is based on the principles of a socially and ecologically oriented market economy.
SMER - social democracy considers the real protection of human dignity in all its basic manifestations, including the economic dimension, to be essential.
Previous experiments in the social field often meant its denial, which had serious personal, family, social, and also political consequences.
SMER - social democracy in the presented alternative fully accepts that the European identity is built precisely on the value of human dignity.
SMER – social democracy with its program supports the direction of the Slovak Republic towards fulfilling its characteristics as a welfare state, as envisaged by the constitution since the creation of the independent Slovak Republic.
A state that respects solidarity, as one of the values ​​on which the European Union is based.
SMER - social democracy advocates the initiation of processes supporting the harmony between the constitutional arrangement and the real form of the market economy.
Economic growth achieved by a socially and ecologically oriented market economy must create conditions for a dignified life for every person, regardless of their gender, age, nationality, ethnicity or level of education.
Economic growth cannot serve only the minority and lead to further deepening of differences between people and regions, to poverty and unemployment.
The basic relations between the economy, the social sphere and nature are regulated by the Constitution of the Slovak Republic and are not subject to the ideology of political parties.
Such an attitude corresponds to the European Union's efforts for a social market economy with high competitiveness, employment, social progress and a high level of environmental protection.
SMER - social democracy wants to promote the European model of a mixed economy.
A balanced interplay between the market and the state is the only way to ensure a higher quality of life in Slovakia, good conditions for work and for employers.
SMER - social democracy fundamentally rejects the privatization of strategic enterprises.
After the elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic, SMER - social democracy does not intend to sacrifice the basic values ​​of the European social model based on an efficient economy in the name of joining the government coalition, which should continue unverified experiments on people with far-reaching negative impacts on their standard of living and future.
SMER - social democracy, in the case of participation in the government, will follow up on all previous measures and decisions that do not contradict the social and ecological nature of the market economy, as directly prescribed by the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
Wherever there has been injustice, a deepening of social inequality and an unjustified attack on the dignity of life, he will uncompromisingly proceed to serious changes and, if necessary, to the cancellation of some decisions taken by the right-wing government coalition in the last eight years.
SMER – social democracy undertakes that, in case of participation in a new government coalition, it will make every effort to achieve a broad political consensus of the government and opposition parties in the case of major decisions concerning the majority of Slovakia's population or exceeding a period of time longer than the four-year election period.
Only such a procedure will ensure the quality and stability of important economic and social measures.
SMER - social democracy calls on all citizens of the Slovak Republic to decide what is just and right by their active participation in the elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic on June 17, 2006.
Is it fair and correct if, despite economic growth, Slovakia is the country with the greatest poverty, the lowest wages and the second highest unemployment in the European Union?
Is it right and fair if seventy percent of working people earn less than the statistically reported average wage?
Is it fair and proper if seventy-five percent of people saw their real wages fall by 7 percent over the past eight years, while twenty-five saw their wages rise by 26 percent?
Is it right and fair if people with above-standard incomes pay the same income tax as average and below-average earners?
Is it right and fair if business entities and the financial sector with huge profits and low income taxes do not have to pay tax on dividends?
Is it fair and right if our pensioners have honestly paid taxes and created values ​​for decades and today they are exposed to living conditions on the border of human dignity?
Is it fair and right if more than 300,000 people, mostly young and often with a high-quality education, have gone to work abroad because Slovakia is not a promising country for them?
Is it fair and right if, despite the constitutionally guaranteed right to free health care, people have to pay more and more directly for the crumbling health care system?
Is it fair and right to make education, health and the right to decent security in old age a commodity?
Is it fair and correct if there are such huge differences between individual regions in such a small area as Slovakia?
Is it fair and proper to sell off state assets abroad cheaply and watch how in 2005 alone, the new owners exported Sk 30 billion of profit generated in Slovak privatized companies abroad?
Is it fair and right that Slovakia will be dependent on the import of food and electricity thanks to right-wing politics?
Is it fair and proper that major financial frauds, clientelism associated with government political parties and endangering democracy by buying the votes of independent members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic remained unpunished?
DIRECTION - social democracy claims that this is neither fair nor right.
SMER - social democracy offers everyone a fair and proper economically efficient social Slovakia.
Slovakia, whose citizen will not be perceived only as a bearer of duties with low wages at high prices.
But as a citizen in whom one must invest, in whom the conditions must be created so that he can fully take his destiny into his own hands and who must be helped if, through no fault of his own, he gets into social or health difficulties.
SMER - social democracy also wants a Slovakia where equality before the law will not only be a proclaimed constitutional right, but above all a basic prerequisite for exposing and punishing those responsible for financial scandals, abuse of powers, clientelism and political corruption.
In order to fulfill its vision of Slovakia, SMER - social democracy, in case of participation in the new government coalition after the elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic on June 17, 2006, sets three basic goals: Fundamentally correct and, if necessary, cancel the so-called the reform steps of the right-wing government, which destroyed the model of a socially and ecologically oriented market economy enshrined in the Constitution of the Slovak Republic (towards a welfare state).
To modernize the welfare state with its clear orientation to the development of society based on knowledge, increase the competitiveness of the Slovak economy and ensure its sustainable growth (prosperity society).
To patiently and forcefully expose and prosecute major cases of economic crime and political corruption in order to restore people's confidence in justice and equality before the law and guarantee the enforcement of law (rule of law).
1. TOWARDS THE WELFARE STATE
"The return to the welfare state will be implemented on the following principles: the economic results of management must be fairly distributed.
The government's attention must shift from macroeconomic numbers embellished with statistical averages to the daily needs and overall quality of life of the majority of citizens.
Reforms must be adapted to social sustainability and the principle of solidarity.
The ability of reasonable intervention must be returned to the state, especially in areas of public needs, in accordance with the balance of private, public and national-state interests of the Slovak Republic."
From the program document SMERU - social democracy "Return to human dignity" adopted in December 2005
SMER - social democracy undertakes, in case of participation in a new government coalition, to promote measures that eliminate or mitigate the negative impacts of the so-called right-wing reforms on the quality of life of the majority of Slovaks.
SMER - social democracy will enforce these measures and ensure their financial coverage to the extent that compliance with the criteria for the planned entry of the Slovak Republic into the European monetary union will not be jeopardized and the necessary rate of economic growth above 5% per year will be ensured.
TAX REFORM
SMER - social democracy perceives the implemented tax reform as beneficial only for people with above-standard incomes and legal entities.
By approving a single 19% VAT rate and subsequently a 19% income tax rate and its tax base and a fundamental increase in consumption taxes, the right-wing government unilaterally dealt with business support at the expense of the middle income class, pensioners, the socially dependent and the disabled.
SMER - Social Democracy considers the abolition of the standard European tax on dividends to be antisocial.
Abolishing the gift tax may contribute to easier legalization of illegal income.
SMER - social democracy cannot consider the simplicity and clarity of the tax system, which are cited as the main arguments for the implementation of the tax reform, as sufficient reasons for such serious interventions in the tax system.
SMER - social democracy does not intend to resign in the name of the simplicity and transparency of the tax system from performing qualified and timely tax and levy control, as the right-wing government did.
SMER - social democracy sees a huge amount of tax arrears and insurance premium arrears, which currently amount to nearly 140 billion. Sk, a great opportunity to obtain the resources necessary for the necessary corrections of right-wing reforms.
SMER - social democracy therefore: - wants to return to tax benefits for disabled citizens, for example a deductible item from the tax base for entrepreneurs who employ them;
-in the case of corporate income tax, he proposes to keep the tax rate at 19%, while the tax base will allow to take into account investment, knowledge-development, scientific-research and ecological costs, which will bring concrete results in the creation of new job opportunities, especially in economically lagging regions, higher added value , higher labor productivity, higher competitiveness on the foreign and domestic markets and a better environment, including the use of alternative energy sources in individual regions;
-proposes introducing a separate higher income tax rate of approximately 25% for natural monopolies, dominant enterprises, financial and banking institutions;
- will introduce an effectively usable and pro-investment tax on dividends;
-in the case of personal income tax, he proposes to introduce progressive taxation, the result of which will be a reduction of taxes for people with low and average incomes, or for the middle class and an increase for people with high above-standard incomes with an emphasis on merit, productive contribution and with the aim of maintaining a motivational character;
-in the case of personal income tax, he proposes to take into account knowledge, development, scientific research, development and ecological costs in the tax base;
-in the case of personal income tax, he proposes an increase in the deductible item from the tax base for special purpose savings, life insurance, as well as for supplementary pension savings;
- will re-introduce the gift tax when donating to third parties;
-submits a proposal for two rates of value added tax, a lower one for selected basic foods, selected medicines, energy, medical and social goods and services that are necessary to ensure basic health care, further in accordance with EU rules for goods and services to support education, schooling, science and research, as well as the informatization of households, including the way to ensure the reflection of these reductions on the consumer;
He proposes to apply the 19% rate to other types of goods and services; propose a reassessment of the economic and social benefits of the category of goods and services exempt from value added tax;
- will advocate for a fundamental improvement in the quality and timeliness of tax and financial controls and for supporting the conditions enabling harsh punishment of taxpayers for tax evasion, or for tax evasion;
-will quantify and address the negative impacts of tax and price corrections on citizens with lower than average incomes and pensions and evaluate their impact on the budget deficit and state debt.
HEALTHCARE REFORM
SMER - social democracy considers health care as a public service provided with public money under public control.
SMER - social democracy considers it absolutely necessary that the constitutional right to free standard health care based on paid insurance is guaranteed in practice.
SMER social democracy is fundamentally opposed to the principle of solidarity in healthcare being replaced by direct payments, to making health a commodity and treating patients a business for the profit of financial groups, as the right-wing government has been promoting for the past four years.
A socially oriented state must not shirk its responsibility for ensuring access to standard health care for all citizens.
If the state decides on the amount of citizens' fees by law and decrees, then the extent of this care must also be defined by law, and to this extent health care must be financed exclusively from health insurance without additional payments by citizens.
The so-called the healthcare reform from the workshop of the right-wing government was primarily intended to create the conditions for the entry of powerful financial groups into the healthcare system and the prerequisites for its privatization.
The annual resources of the Slovak healthcare system are around 100 billion. Sk, which attracts the attention of all those who prefer healthcare based on the market principle to healthcare as a service to the public.
Considering these goals of the reform, the right-wing government not only did not improve the provision of health care, but on the contrary made it difficult for citizens to access quality services, and for some citizens, the reform made it difficult to access even basic health care, increased patient participation in the co-financing of the health care system, dishonored the entire medical situation and put citizens against health workers.
The so-called the health care reform of the right-wing government requires the most radical interventions by the new government coalition.
SMER - social democracy therefore: above all, it will make every effort to restore citizens' trust in health care providers, which goes hand in hand with humanizing the approach of health professionals to patients and adequately evaluating the work of doctors and nurses;
enforces the immediate abolition of the 20,- Sk and 50,- Sk charges in ambulances and hospitals;
it will once again allow those who need it the most and cannot afford it to receive spa treatment;
- will enforce such an increase in financial resources for the health sector, including higher payments by the state for its insured persons, in order to achieve economic stabilization of the health care system;
- it will restore the public character of health insurance companies, because it fundamentally disagrees with the fact that public funds from the state and citizens intended exclusively for ensuring the provision of health care are collected in health insurance companies - joint-stock companies oriented towards maximum profit even at the expense of the scope and quality of health care;
- the law will re-determine the maximum amount of expenses for the performance of the internal administration of health insurance companies;
- will support the development of optional additional health insurance to ensure citizens' access to above-standard health care;
- will use all possibilities for financing investment activities in the health sector from European Union funds;
- will promote the creation of a joint fund of health insurance companies and the state to finance particularly demanding procedures, such as transplants, heart operations, or oncological treatment in order to ensure this type of health care for every citizen whose health condition requires it;
-legislatively create the conditions for the improvement of working and living conditions, primarily of doctors in hospitals, but also of first contact doctors;
- will support the restructuring of the network of medical facilities based on clearly defined criteria in advance, which will lead to the optimization of the network of providers in order to ensure the availability of health care for every patient;
-will orientate the healthcare system to the prevention and early diagnosis of diseases; will prefer ambulatory forms of treatment, including day surgery, and support the development of home nursing care agencies;
will develop the most important preventive programs aimed at heart and blood vessel diseases, cancer, a program for mother and child and a comprehensive care program for the elderly;
creates dignified conditions for disabled citizens for their equal inclusion in society;
will support the decentralization of healthcare management while retaining the control and regulatory role of the state;
in hospital care, he will enforce that the state remains the founder of the former hospitals III. type, specialized workplaces with pan-Slovak scope and selected professional medical institutions, while these facilities will not be joint stock companies;
- in the field of drug policy, the main goal will be to ensure effective, safe and high-quality drugs for the entire population in the objectively necessary quantity and at a reasonable price;
will promote the principle that at least one medication for each serious illness is fully covered by the insurance company and that the lists of medications fully or partially covered by health insurance are prepared by experts without the influence of various interest groups;
- as one of the basic tasks, it will support the informatization of healthcare based on the latest information and communication technologies with the aim of promoting fundamental de-bureaucratization of the healthcare system, while at the same time increasing the quality of services provided and economy in the use of resources;
- cancel all unnecessary administrative actions and duplications in the activities of the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic, enforce a thorough audit of its activities with subsequent rationalization of the number of workers;
-fundamentally changes the position, financing and especially the tasks of the Office for Health Care Supervision so that it changes from a power institution to a coordinating, methodical and controlling institution;
- it will support the development of the education of healthcare workers at all levels, because together with prevention, it leads to a reduction in healthcare costs;
will create prerequisites for the successful introduction of health information and communication technologies.
PENSION REFORM
SMER - social democracy will uncompromisingly insist on the strict observance of the constitutional right to adequate material security in old age in its practical policy.
The economic and social policy of the right-wing government has affected the dignity of life in the elderly and exposes a large part of pensioners to intractable financial and social situations.
It is precisely the people of retirement age who have the greatest merit in the creation of values, which have become the subject of endless tunneling and privatization, but whose standard of living has been most threatened.
SMER – social democracy, in addition to the necessity of constantly equalizing pensions with rising living costs, emphasizes the vital need to take other measures at the same time, especially in the tax area (reduced rate of value added tax on selected goods and services), in the health sector (abolition of fees related to the provided health care, medicine policy) and in the area of ​​energy prices, so that the granted pensions create conditions for a dignified life.
According to the SMER party - social democracy, the pension reform implemented by the right-wing government without any broader political consensus and with fundamental material deficiencies creates many risks and injustices.
After the creation of private pension management companies (DSS), to which a substantial part of the social insurance resources go from the public Social Insurance Company, there is a serious threat to the ability of the Social Insurance Company to ensure the functionality of this basic pillar of pension security in the coming years.
SMER - social democracy respects the creation of the so-called of the second capitalization pillar and, in case of participation in the new government coalition, will support its preservation.
SMER - social democracy strongly warns that the loss of income of the Social Insurance Company as a result of the creation of private DSS will have to be covered from public resources (approximately Sk 20 billion per year), at the expense of other needs of society and at the cost of an increase in the deficit of public finances and total indebtedness of the Slovak Republic.
SMER - social democracy will proceed with reform changes and corrections based on analyzes and agreements with social partners and professional associations.
Fundamental changes will be made after agreement with a wider range of political parties and relevant interested groups.
With such a procedure, SMER - social democracy in the field of social security wants to stabilize the system as much as possible.
SMER - social democracy recognizes the right to adequate material security in old age, while the social insurance system must be set up in such a way that it is transparent, financially sustainable, socially just and guarantees adequate pensions.
In a socially sensitive and considered way, SMER - social democracy will make the necessary changes in order to eliminate non-systemic and discriminatory elements of the current social insurance system as well as to resolve ownership relations.
As part of the repairs to the current system, the parameters of the individual levels of social insurance must be reassessed, based on an analysis of the tax, contribution and levy burden on employees, employers, self-employed persons and the state.
In order to fulfill the basic constitutional right to adequate material security in old age, to eliminate the risks and injustices of the pension reform, especially in the way of calculating old-age pensions for all beneficiaries according to the same rules, as well as to create prerequisites for respecting the so-called of the second capitalization pillar, SMER – social democracy will promote and support:
basic – defined by law in terms of benefits – mandatory level of social insurance financed on an ongoing basis and fully guaranteed by the state; this degree will be based on the principle of solidarity combined with the principle of merit;
- the necessary stabilization of the basic level of social security, which is threatened by the privatization of the financial resources of the Social Insurance Company in favor of private DSS;
-valuation of pensions, so-called old-age pensioners and pensioners and reducing the differences between them; - introduction of the minimum pension institute;
- tripartite management model and public law of the basic level of social insurance;
- a systemic solution for disability pensions in order to eliminate injustices in the reassessment of the conditions for the occurrence of disability and illogical links between individual groups of disabled people;
- prerequisites for social assistance of relatives to elderly and severely disabled citizens in households and the equalization of such caregivers with social workers;
-old-age pension savings as an additional private second level of social insurance based on the principle of capitalization and the principle of merit.
This system will be transformed into a voluntary pension system, the product of which will be provided both by specialized institutions and by non-specific financial institutions while fully respecting the purpose, i.e. ensuring a regular income during the entire period of survival in old age;
supplementary pension savings transformed into employee pension insurance as a supplementary degree based on merit and tax-advantaged;
the employee pension insurance will be derived from the favorable social policy of the employer and financed from the contributions of the employee and the employer on a voluntary basis, or as a result of collective bargaining.
It will be tax-advantaged.
Employee pension insurance companies will be managed by contributors on a bipartite basis.
LABOR LEGISLATION REFORM
SMER - social democracy respects that the model of an economically efficient welfare state requires a certain degree of workforce flexibility.
However, it refuses if it is to be guaranteed only on the basis of a unilateral approach beneficial exclusively to the employer.
In the creation of new labor law legislation, SMER - social democracy will be based on the modern concept of the essence of the knowledge economy, in which man plays an increasingly important role as a central factor in economic growth, because it is the knowledge that man has produced and that he possesses that is the decisive factor prosperity.
SMER - social democracy is convinced that the neoliberal Labor Code needs to be returned in several provisions to the state it was in before the last major amendment.
The Labor Code and other labor-law regulations must ensure the balance of the exercise of rights between the employee and the employer, dignified working conditions and higher protection of the employee as is typical for European labor-law relations.
SMER – social democracy, in case of participation in the new government coalition, will fully respect the obligations resulting from the agreements concluded between this political party and the Confederation of Trade Unions of the Slovak Republic and individual trade unions.
SMER – social democracy will therefore push for changes in the field of labor law legislation which:
In the private sector:
-on the one hand, they will protect employees from unjustified dismissal from employment and on the other hand, they will simplify the dismissal of an unscrupulous or incompetent employee;
- they will guarantee the consistent application of the principle of equal treatment in employment and fair remuneration for work;
- they will eliminate the practice of performing work for the employer based on "forced" trade to perform dependent work;
-eliminate cases of abuse of a fixed-term employment relationship, which occurs by chaining such employment relationships and repeatedly negotiating a trial period;
-determine the maximum weekly working time, including overtime, even in the case of work for several employers, and eliminate the possibility of discrimination against employees employed by temporary employment agencies;
they guarantee the employee's legal right to severance pay without it being tied to an agreement to terminate the employment relationship before the notice period begins;
- they will introduce the protection of the rights of employees working part-time (up to 20 hours per week);
-in the area of ​​health and safety at work, they will strengthen the mechanisms for the participation of employee representatives, especially in the determination of labor consumption standards and in the scheduling of working hours, and will support systemic education in this area;
- improve the conditions of safety and health protection at work, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises;
- they will introduce a stricter regime of sanctions for open, but also hidden forms of suppression of individual and collective rights of employees, including strengthening control and supervision of compliance with labor law regulations and support for the effective functioning of the labor inspection.
In the real sector:
-remove labor law distortions caused by the repeal of the Public Service Act and its replacement by the Act on the Performance of Work in the Public Interest and the Act on the Remuneration of Certain Employees in the Performance of Work in the Public Interest, as well as those caused by the current wording of the Civil Service Act.
The new legal regulation of employment relations of public sector employees (including civil servants) will be based on the modern concept of public service and will correspond to the European social and legal culture of employment relations of public sector employees;
- they will ensure that public and state employees can refuse direct or indirect participation in proceedings that serve to cover up the corruption of their superiors in the management of public resources and in public procurement, without fear of losing their jobs.
SOCIAL DIALOGUE
SMER-social democracy recognizes social dialogue as an effective tool for the participation of employees and employers in the formulation of economic and social policy.
It fundamentally rejects the actions of the right-wing government leading to the suppression of the role of trade unions and will make every effort to restore to trade unions the position of an effective defender of the interests of employees and an equal participant in the social dialogue.
The most important policy goals of the SMER - Social Democracy party in the area of ​​social dialogue support include: - creating conditions for reaching a consensus of social partners on economic and social policy;
- create conditions for the smooth functioning of collective bargaining;
SMER - social democracy proposes: - to develop a model of institutionalized tripartite consultations, which will create an optimal framework for effective, constructive social dialogue at all levels, primarily:
-renew the activity of the Economic and Social Agreement Council as a body of tripartite consultations based on the principle of equal social partnership of the government, trade unions and employers' organizations;
- introduce (or revive) sectoral councils of the economic and social agreement;
-support the creation (or revival) of regional economic and social agreement councils;
- to increase the stability of the social environment, strengthen the bipartite social dialogue between employers and trade unions, primarily:
-remove barriers to effective collective bargaining through legislative measures;
- through legislative measures, introduce a model of extending the binding nature of collective agreements of a higher level to other employers in accordance with the relevant conventions of the International Labor Organization;
-strengthen the position of the trade union within the employee participation mechanisms in the company;
- restore the tripartite nature of the Social Insurance Company and health insurance companies as a public institution with a tripartite management model;
- by law, adjust the conditions for the exercise of the constitutional right to strike so that the rights and claims of employees are not violated.
SOCIAL ASSISTANCE REFORM
SMER - social democracy rejects the idea that the deepening of poverty is only the result of a citizen's failure.
Therefore, it will maximally support the combination of a person's responsibility for his own destiny and that of his family, social solidarity and assistance from the state, local self-government bodies, civil society institutions, including self-help groups.
SMER - social democracy will create conditions for an increase in the birth rate and financial support for families with dependent children, through tax benefits and financial support:
SMER - social democracy aims at greater participation and solidarity with young people, families, children, the sick and disabled, pensioners.
Creating a welfare state with links to the market economy for the SMER party - social democracy means that social security, health care, adequate housing and education are necessary investments for higher labor productivity and are a prerequisite for further economic growth.
The most important policy goals of the SMER - Social Democracy party in the field of social security include: - gradual elimination of poverty and social exclusion;
- improve social cohesion;
-create conditions for a dignified life for all people, especially for -disadvantaged groups of people and the elderly;
-create conditions for favorable psychological, physical and social development of children.
Achieving these goals is a basic condition for sustaining economic growth. The social support system will be based on complete solidarity and the same right for everyone who meets the conditions established by law.
State s ocial p resistance
by increasing the allowance upon the birth of the first child;
by gradually increasing the parental allowance;
by eliminating discrimination against parents who cannot place a child in a pre-school facility managed by the municipality.
Help in material need and in social need
The fight against poverty and social inclusion will be central priorities for SMER - social democracy, while the solution will be approached on the basis of an interdisciplinary, multi-sectoral, inter-ministerial and multi-level solution to the problem.
With the aim of gradually eliminating poverty SMER - social democracy: increase the scope and quality of field social work;
adjusts the parameters of benefits and allowances and aid in material distress;
re-adjusts the structure and height of the subsistence minimum so that it really corresponds to the basic needs of life;
will ensure a systemic solution to preventing the causes of involuntary homelessness;
- will legislatively regulate the protection of apartment rentals for persons with severe disabilities, families with children and senior citizens;
-ensures the transfer of competences in the area of ​​material need to municipalities (as a transferred exercise of state administration), while limiting the general payment of benefits in material need and introducing addressed and non-cash aid, and at the same time more significantly adjusting the possibility of using a special recipient when providing help in material need;
- when handing over competences to local self-government bodies, he will ensure strict compliance with the principle of subsidiarity as well as material-technical, personnel and financial security for the performance of the transferred competences;
- in the interest of a systemic solution to the social situation of persons with severe disabilities SMER – social democracy will legislatively adjust the system of assistance to persons in social need based on targeted cash contributions and social services.
In this context, it will develop social "business" based on the non-profit principle in the field of social services and create a legislative environment for the support and development of social services;
- to alleviate the social situation of recipients of old-age pensions, he will promote the provision of a Christmas allowance differentiated according to the amount of pensions;
- with the aim of transparency of financial flows in the entire social security system, he will introduce a complex information system of the social sphere, compatible with other information systems within the public sector and in order to simplify the conditions for drawing European funds, including a link to their agenda.
SMER - social democracy does not want and cannot resign when solving acute problems related to the status of the Roma national minority
. The right-wing government, with its hypocritical policy, deepened the social exclusion of the members of this minority and delayed any more visible shift in the quality of their lives.
SMER - social democracy perceives the position of the Roma national minority as incompatible with the position of the Slovak Republic in Europe.
He sees this issue as unsolvable without the active help of the state and European institutions.
Current initiatives do not address the main issue – the integration of Roma into Slovak society, most of the activities do not have a widespread effect or are only an effort to mitigate mainly social impacts.
SMER - social democracy will initiate the development of a project that will mean a systemic, comprehensive solution.
SMER - social democracy is aware that this is a difficult, long-term issue and will seek support and cooperation for it across the entire political spectrum.
It is also important that representative Roma organizations participate in the creation of relevant measures and decisions and that the principle that there are no rights without duties and responsibilities is applied in principle.
SMER - social democracy is also ready to take the following measures after evaluating the proposals submitted by Roma organizations:
- consistently tie a significant part of state social assistance to members of the Roma national minority to the fulfillment of specific obligations, in particular to the obligation to ensure proper care for children of preschool and school age (school attendance), the obligation to actively apply for a job and adequate care for the environment in which this the national minority lives;
-legislatively adjust material motivation for members of the Roma national minority who secure employment through an active approach;
- proceed with the adjustment of ownership relations to the land on which there are Roma settlements;
- establish professional regional workplaces with relevant competences;
-to carry out an audit of specific projects of assistance to the Roma national minority in order to prevent inefficient spending of funds;
-support the construction of social housing, assuming the active participation of interested members of the Roma national minority;
- proceed with the amendment of the so-called of the anti-discrimination law with the aim of harmonizing positive discrimination with the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic.
2. PROSPERITY COMPANY
"SMER - social democracy considers the lack of emphasis on the support of education, science and research to be a mistake in the development of the Slovak Republic so far.
Based on experience from developed countries, as well as from the point of view of global trends, it is clear that this is an area whose well-thought-out, long-term and intensive support is a basic condition for Slovakia's competitiveness."
From the program document SMERU - social democracy "Return to human dignity" adopted in December 2005
SMER – social democracy must state that the price paid by the citizens of the Slovak Republic for economic growth based on cheap labor, liberal labor legislation, reduction and remission of taxes for business entities, above-standard support for foreign investors and privatization of strategic enterprises is the highest in the entire European Union.
Just as in social policy, it will also be important in economic policy to actively respond to the impending polarization of wealth and poverty, which may further accentuate Slovakia's fragile orientation towards the automotive industry and further deepen the poverty of more than one fifth of Slovakia's citizens.
SMER - social democracy must state that the right-wing government was not able to present a generally acceptable strategy for the development of the Slovak Republic in the medium and long term during its eight years of rule.
The development of Slovakia was left entirely in the hands of the free market, which naturally led to the widening of differences between a small group of very wealthy people and the substantial majority living on average and below-average incomes, as well as to drastic regional differences.
SMER - social democracy must state that the right-wing government has not taken any practical steps in two election periods to change the society of cheap labor into a society based on education, scientific knowledge and information.
Hand in hand with the formal declarations of the right-wing government on the knowledge economy, Slovakia shows one of the lowest evaluations of work in education, when the average salaries in this area were 17% lower than the average salaries in the national economy.
The quality of the educational process continued to decline.
Investments in research and development were the lowest in the OECD and the fourth lowest in the European Union.
Billions of dollars have been invested in information systems without any visible effect.
SMER - social democracy must state that unregulated market rules have led to the second highest unemployment in the European Union and to a massive departure for work abroad, the second largest after the 30s of the last century.
More than 300,000 people with high school and university education, often top experts, left the Slovak Republic because they could not find employment in their own country, or only employment for wages that did not ensure a dignified life worthy of a member state of the European Union.
SMER - social democracy must state that continuing the current economic and social policy of the right-wing government means deepening inequality and social injustice and delaying the approach to the average standard of living of the developed member countries of the European Union until 2040-2045.
The social and ecologically oriented market economy guaranteed by the Constitution of the Slovak Republic is incompatible with the economic policy of the right-wing government.
DIRECTION - social democracy wants a society of prosperity in which the achieved economic growth will be shared more fairly.
A society really, and not just formally, based on education, knowledge and information.
Our wealth must be a qualified and educated person.
SMER - social democracy in building a knowledge-based economy supports the goals of the European Union, where the quality of human resources will play a key role in ensuring economic growth in the field of inputs.
This is the only way we can compete, this is the only way we can speed up the leveling of the huge differences between rich and poor Slovak regions and getting closer to the standard of living of developed Europe.
All practical decisions and measures will be subordinated to this idea of ​​SMER - social democracy, while fully respecting three goals: the necessity of sustainable economic growth above 5% of gross domestic product per year,
employment growth and
criteria enabling the planned entry of the Slovak Republic into the monetary union in accordance with the interests of Slovak citizens and EU conditions.
SMER - social democracy also sets itself the ambitious goal of presenting the medium- and long-term development strategy of the Slovak Republic for a broad professional and public debate in the 2006-2010 election period and reaching a broad political agreement on it.
Only such an approach will ensure the continuity and stability of the fundamental strategic direction of the Slovak Republic, regardless of the program and ideology of successive government coalitions.
EDUCATION, KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICAL SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE - THE WAY TO PROSPERITY
DIRECTION - social democracy intends to elevate education and the ability to apply it to the highest pedestal of social values.
DIRECTION - social democracy will support education, science and research, information technology, because today it is the best way to form a knowledge, knowledge, information and cultural society.
SMER - social democracy will therefore, in case of participation in the new government coalition, immediately push for fundamental changes in legislation and redistribution of funds - intelligent investments, so that the following decisions in the field of education, culture and sports can be implemented:
--gradually achieve spending on education in the amount of 5% of the gross domestic product;
-increase public funds for higher education with the aim of reaching 1.2% of GDP outside of financial resources aimed at the social area of ​​students;
-approve the new modern law on upbringing and education as a basic prerequisite for content reform in education;
-approve a new law on the status of teaching staff with a new motivating salary system, professional growth and social status;
-approve the amendment of the Higher Education Act with reference to the new needs of higher education and science, to improve the quality of the educational and scientific-research process with a connection to the current requirements of practice;
- in no case should the underfunding of education be solved, for example, by charging for university studies, but by multi-source financing of universities with strict control of the funds spent;
- create the prerequisites for real informatization of education associated with significantly more extensive use of modern didactic aids, especially information technology and multimedia technology in the teaching process within the framework of modern educational and scientific methods and approaches;
-approve a new law on the financing of culture at the level of the state, regions, cities and municipalities and create a grant agency for culture and art;
-approve a new law on the support of sports with the aim of supporting state representation, regional, youth and academic sports and create provisions for the establishment of an independent grant agency;
-approve the new law on non-formal education and the new law on volunteering;
- implement the project: Let's return science, culture and sports to our schools;
- eliminate discrimination in the financing of state and public schools, especially in relation to the above-standard status of non-state schools, the so-called private schools;
-support the creation of full-day schools within the learning society, include kindergartens in the school network, reduce the number of children and pupils in classes, improve the quality of art education within the basic level of art education, support the development of vocational education and lifelong learning
SMER - social democracy considers the transition to a knowledge-based economy impossible without fundamental interventions in the support of science and research. SMER - social democracy will therefore:
-legislatively motivate the business sector to invest in education, science, research and development;
- to expand the conditions for higher education, especially in the fields of informatics and information technologies, nanotechnologies and biotechnology;
-gradually increase the amount of funding for science, research and development, by transparent funding of the Research and Development Support Agency, universities, the Slovak Academy of Sciences, research facilities, but also small and medium-sized research and development centers up to 0.8% from GDP from public sources;
- create investment incentives – intelligent investments supporting the creation of technological incubators at SAS universities, departmental and corporate scientific, research and development workplaces with high added value;
- create a grant system and a system of special grants for young scientists and doctoral students in order to stop the brain drain and stabilize the young educated generation;
-support scientific workplaces that will become part of the virtual network of technology centers in Europe and centers of excellence that will programmatically cooperate with corporate research and development workplaces and businesses.
CULTURE AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
SMER - social democracy considers the development of culture as a necessary condition for improving the quality of life of the inhabitants of the Slovak Republic.
It is important for culture to create better economic conditions, but also to clearly articulate the conviction that culture is not a superfluous luxury that can wait until the state copes with the consequences of economic transformation.
It is important that everyone has the opportunity to constantly be in active or at least passive contact with values ​​that enable the cultivation of the spiritual dimension as an individual, but also as a part of society.
SMER - social democracy considers it important to declare: - support for the creation, protection and dissemination of culture and cultural values ​​as well as their professional reflection;
- readiness to take measures that will enable multi-source support for the development of culture in the entire spectrum, from education and protection of monuments to professional artistic activities;

- to support non-traditional projects for the active integration of material and cultural heritage into the present and the effort to use the existing potential for touristic use;
-willingness to perceive Slovak culture as a summary of activities developed not only on the territory of our country, but also in Slovak communities abroad;
INFORMATIZATION OF THE COMPANY
SMER - social democracy considers informatization as a phenomenon that cross-sectionally affects the entire society and has a fundamental qualitative impact on it.
The ability to effectively use information technology is, according to SMERU - social democracy, the key to economic success and thus to the prosperity of the entire society.
SMER - social democracy will therefore: - promote changes in teaching and equipping elementary, vocational and secondary schools with computer technology, which will enable teachers, pupils and students to achieve full computer literacy;
-ensure through the Internet free access of citizens to all information, the source of which is the public administration and which is publicly available by law;

-quickly eliminate the time slippage in the fulfillment of tasks resulting from the Slovak Republic's membership in the European Union in the field of electronic communications and computerization of public administration;
-draws strict consequences from the demonstrable waste of funds used for computerization without a visible effect;
for this purpose, he will push for an expedited audit of the use of funds invested in information technologies in the state and public administration;
- will create a special state administration body responsible for fulfilling the tasks of informatization of public administration and efficient use of European Union funds intended for the informatization of society.
TRANSPORT AND TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE
SMER - social democracy considers mobility to be one of the basic prerequisites for the prosperity of society.
In case of participation in the new government coalition, he will uphold the principle according to which it is necessary to provide high-quality transport services at reasonable prices in order to ensure adequate accessibility for the citizen to work, trade, offices, medical care, culture, or other activities.
The state and local government must ensure the creation of conditions for the provision of a suitable public transport service.
SMER - social democracy will promote the investment program in transport not only from the point of view of fulfilling the criteria for connecting transport routes with other states and an even network of infrastructure of individual types of transport, but also as a fundamental contribution to improving the social status of the population and employment in more backward regions.
SMER - social democracy considers it necessary to: - approve a new binding concept of transport policy by 2015;
-in road transport, speed up the process of construction of highways and high-speed roads while maintaining the current funding ratio so that by 2010 at least 120 km of the D1 highway have been completed and put into use, by 2012 the entire D1 highway in the Bratislava-Košice route was completed and by 2010 connecting the towns of Trnava – Banská Bystrica by high-speed road R1 together with the removal of point defects on R2, in order to reduce the lack of access to attractive areas of Slovakia and individual regions for investors;
-at the same time, continue the preparation and gradual construction of other sections of highways and high-speed roads necessary to connect poorly developed regions with centers of industry and trade, among others, the north-south connection of central (R3) and eastern (R4) Slovakia, as well as the completion of D1 on the Slovakia-Ukraine border ;
- enforce the development of cost analysis and price determination for highway construction with the aim of objectifying the procedure for concluding contracts with suppliers and thereby more efficiently spending public resources;
-remove chronic deficiencies in protection against damage to road infrastructure by overloading it by immediately introducing truck weighing;
-significantly favor means of transport with an alternative drive that saves the environment;
-in rail transport, the goal is to increase the number of transported persons and maintain the current volume of transported goods (by 2010, at least a 20% share of railways in the total volume of transported goods in the Slovak Republic) and thus prioritize rail transport over road transport;
- submit a proposal for a holding arrangement of railway companies, consolidate the situation in Cargo Slovakia, a.s., reevaluate the current distribution of assets and prevent the sale of the company leading to the loss of state control over its assets and the possibility of effective enforcement of the state's interests;
- to introduce a crisis mode of financing and management in all three railway companies for the purpose of their financial stabilization;
- to achieve, in cooperation with the local government, more accessible and better services for the traveling public without increasing the basic fare during the entire election period 2006-2010 and to maintain or to expand the range of fare discounts and thereby create a cheaper, attractive alternative to individual transport from passenger rail transport;
- to financially secure intentions in transport, use all available resources from European funds and resources created by infrastructure users themselves, where a significant change will be more objective charging of highways and roads for motor vehicles in the form of electronic toll collection;
-in air transport, to insist on the decisive influence of the state in airport joint-stock companies Bratislava, Košice with the aim of promoting state, regional and local interests in cooperation with the local government;
-examine and evaluate in detail all options for canceling the extremely disadvantageous privatization of airports for Slovakia, which was carried out by the current right-wing government.
ENERGY
SMER – social democracy considers Slovakia's energy industry to be a key factor in ensuring the sustainable development of the economy and increasing the social status of Slovakia's inhabitants.
Competitive energy, recognized at home and abroad, providing an efficient and stable supply of energy to broad layers of society while respecting the impact on the social sphere and the environment, is the long-term goal of the SMER party - social democracy.
SMER - social democracy is aware that the sale of Slovnaft, SPP, Slovenské elektrární and the shutdown of the Jaslovské Bohuníce NPP puts Slovakia in a highly disadvantageous situation when decisions about Slovak energy are made abroad.
Slovakia is deprived of energy self-sufficiency.
SMER - social democracy: - will initiate the development and adoption of a new energy policy based on a broad agreement of political and professional structures;
- will review the current regulatory framework, introduce the necessary information flows, strengthen the control and regulatory capabilities of the state where the market is not able to create a sufficiently competitive environment.
If necessary, SMER - social democracy is ready to initiate activities at the level of the European Union;

-ensures the state's position in the decision-making bodies of privatized companies corresponding to its ownership stake;
- will support the accelerated completion of the third and fourth units of the Mochovce NPP.
AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND WATER MANAGEMENT, ENVIRONMENT AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
SMER - social democracy considers agriculture, forestry and water management to be an important part of the national economy and rural development.
We understand the agrarian department as a creator of job opportunities in the countryside, a landscape designer and a creator of significant financial resources for local governments.
SMER - social democracy: - will promote a system of financial support in agriculture that will give Slovak farmers equal rights with farmers in neighboring countries and enable fair competition within the European Union;
- will take measures to improve the development of the agricultural land market and enable farmers to acquire land owned by the state in the form of long-term installments so that ownership and use rights are combined and the enterprises operating on the land are stabilized;
-increase the protection of the agricultural land fund and re-introduce levies for the acquisition of agricultural and forest land;
- will promote such an environmental policy in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, which will provide Slovakia with a competitive advantage and at the same time opportunities on the labor market;
-creates a program for the development of production and consumption of renewable energy sources,
v will support the use of alternative energy devices,

the basic goal will be the protection and improvement of forests in order to ensure the ecological balance and stability of the country with the full use of wood and other forest products;
- enforces the non-privatization of state forest lands;
- adopt a long-term strategy of the state in the form of the National Forestry Program, which will harmonize the various interests of society, forest owners and other interest groups in the balanced use of all productive and public benefit functions of forests, their protection and permanent development;
to ensure the implementation of this long-term state policy, it will adopt new laws on nature and landscape protection, on forests and on hunting, excluding current conflicting provisions;
SMER - social democracy will take care of the fulfillment of the constitutional right of forest owners to adequate compensation for the limitation of property rights resulting from them;
-speed up the settlement of ownership relations to forests and other immovable property on forest lands of non-state owners;
- will implement measures to improve the quality protection of surface and underground waters from pollution and ensure the rational use of existing water resource capacities in accordance with the principles of protection of water ecosystems for sufficient drinking water and water for economic purposes;
-create conditions for efficient use of irrigation and drainage systems for agricultural production;
in the field of flood protection, it will prepare a plan of real steps for water management adjustments and maintenance of anti-flood objects and will introduce measures to improve the flood warning system;
- will create conditions for the use of local rural resources for the development of tourism and agritourism.
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND EUROFUNDS
SMER - social democracy perceives huge regional differences in the relatively small territory of the Slovak Republic as a natural result of right-wing politics based only on the rules of the pure market.
Neglect of the transport infrastructure, reduced mobility of the workforce, the absence of any strategy for the development of Slovakia and the absence of interregional solidarity have led some parts of the Slovak Republic to backwardness, poverty, people leaving for work in other areas of Slovakia and abroad, and to the aging of the local population in poor living conditions.
SMER - social democracy sees the regions of Banskobystrický, Košický and Prešovský as particularly problematic.
In these risky regions, SMER - social democracy will enforce the adoption of government development projects.
These, together with the use of tax and levy instruments to stimulate local small and medium-sized businesses, more consistent direction of foreign investments, allocation of financial resources from the aid of the European Union and increased support for tourism, will gradually start the process of more even social and economic development on the territory of the Slovak Republic.
SMER – social democracy will promote the creation of a coordinating body at the level of the government of the Slovak Republic for the fight against poverty and the development of lagging regions.
Development programs for underdeveloped regions, which will make it possible to draw money from the resources of the European Union, are considered by SMER - social democracy to be particularly effective.
When properly used, European funds clearly support the dynamics of the development of the country and its individual parts.
SMER - social democracy is fully aware of the importance and need to implement a clearer and more effective system of evaluating relevant projects, which will ensure a regular, even and geographically optimal distribution of European Union funds.
SMER - social democracy will therefore advocate that: - the strategy for the development of the Slovak Republic in the medium and long term, which it intends to submit for professional and public discussion and approve on the basis of a broad political agreement, also contains an agreement on the national strategic reference framework of the Slovak Republic for the years 2007 – 2013;
- the public's awareness of the possibilities of using European Union funds has increased;
- there was a transfer of some powers in the field of programming and implementation of programs and projects supported by European Union funds to self-governing regions and cities and municipalities (especially in the case of NUTS II, NUTS III regional programs);
- a high professional and qualification level of workers dealing with the relevant agenda in individual ministries was ensured and the turnover of qualified experts was minimized;
- from the level of the relevant ministry responsible for regional development, as well as from individual higher territorial units, qualified experts were secured for the needs of project processing for individual regions, cities and municipalities;
- the lengthy project evaluation process was shortened and thus minimized the difficulties associated with the efficient use of European Union resources, which is at a very low level;
-increased the control and transparency of the use of European funds and eliminated the risk of return of allocated resources and imposition of severe sanctions.
INVESTMENT INCENTIVES
SMER - social democracy intends to pay more attention to investment incentives in smaller investment projects and to create good conditions for the entry of investors into small and medium-sized businesses.
SMER - social democracy does not consider it a correct policy to apply differences in the support of domestic and foreign investments.
He sees the change from a passive search for investors to an active search connected with social priorities, especially in the field of education, research and development and complex, especially regional, infrastructure, as extremely important.
SMER - social democracy will be based on the assumption that for a foreign investor, stimulation in the form of cooperation in the field of research and development, the provision of qualified workers, assistance in the field of education of citizens and their retraining as financial or tax benefits becomes more important for the foreign investor.
SMER - social democracy will: - due to certain risks of the concentration of the automotive industry in the territory of the Slovak Republic, diversify the structure of investment incentives for foreign investors for several industries and customers;
-develop the domestic scientific and research base so that its own patents and inventions are used as investment incentives for foreign as well as domestic investors;
- create prerequisites for the establishment of internationally recognized logistics workplaces.
LABOR MARKET AND BUSINESS SUPPORT
SMER - social democracy considers the highest possible rate of employed people to be one of the basic criteria for the success of economic and social policy.
The second highest unemployment rate in the European Union proves that the neoliberal model of the current right-wing government has failed, because the achieved economic growth is not capable of creating a sufficient number of jobs.
SMER - social democracy wants to focus on a t repartition relationship and active cooperation with the local government in solving unemployment.
When budgeting resources from the European Union, we want to rely on the consensus of opinion of the social partners.
When applying employment policy and labor market policy, in agreement with social partners, it is necessary to consider the creation of a public-law institution that would be dedicated exclusively to employment services and would have its branches in the regions.
This institution would rely mainly on the use of resources from the European Social Fund and in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic would implement national, regional and specific programs for employment support.
The reduction of unemployment will be ensured by the combination of the creation of new jobs with appropriately stimulated investments, the transition to a knowledge-based economy and the effective use of regional programs with the support of European Union resources.
Attention must be focused on the development programs of crisis regions, with priority to industries with high added value.
SMER - Social Democracy perceives as particularly important an increase in resources for an active employment policy in relation to long-term unemployed persons, unemployed in lagging regions and disadvantaged groups, in which SMER - Social Democracy includes young people immediately after finishing high school or university education, the disabled, mothers with children and people close to retirement age.
The priority tool will be the development of human resources focused on the key abilities of people to effectively engage in economic activities in the knowledge economy.
Emphasis will be placed on the ability of people to position themselves in the labor market, especially through the support of targeted educational programs taking into account the labor market in the given territory.
SMER – social democracy supports, in the case of providing financial support in unemployment and social benefits, the application of the principle on the basis of which rights are always linked to specific duties and responsibilities (the introduction of the obligation to perform a specified number of hours of community service as a condition for the payment of social benefits).
SMER - social democracy will re-introduce a support tool, or acquiring work habits for the long-term registered unemployed through a program of supported public benefit services with the aim of creating sustainable jobs for low-skilled labor, which are a basic prerequisite for breaking away from dependence on social benefits.
The benefit will also be the building of a functional system of supported employment agencies that, in accordance with regional development plans based on the cooperation of the private sector, state administration and local governments, will create prerequisites for securing permanent employment for employees in industries with a predominant need for seasonal workers.
SMER - social democracy sees significant opportunities for creating new jobs in regions with higher unemployment in the area of ​​using renewable energy sources.
DIRECTION - social democracy will support the idea of ​​more significant assistance in creating and maintaining jobs for citizens with reduced work ability.
In order to increase citizens' willingness to accept part-time employment, or half-time will prepare a system for solving motivational elements for participation in such a program.
In the field of business support, SMER - social democracy: - will remove administrative and legislative barriers and simplify and speed up entry into business so that a budding entrepreneur can complete all requirements in one place;
-logically aligns the period of payments to insurance funds with the period of business;
-reevaluates the connection of the levy burden of self-employed and small entrepreneurs to the minimum wage and simplifies its selection;
-support the creation of a network of business incubators and advisory services using support programs;
-establish a government council for small and medium-sized businesses in accordance with the European Charter for Small Businesses in order to optimize business conditions;
-supports the promotion of products and services of business entities from Slovakia on the domestic and foreign markets;
- will increase the transparency of the provision of state aid by centrally publishing its recipients;
- will support domestic tourism in the form of an employer's contribution to the regeneration of the workforce at home as a cost item;
- will restore tax or levy reliefs for employers when employing persons with reduced working capacity;
- will adapt secondary vocational education and schools to the needs of all types of business at the regional level and will create prerequisites for an economically motivating connection of such education with the business sphere.
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE FAMILY
SMER - social democracy considers its active support of young people and young families when starting working and family life to be a fundamental duty of the state and a vital issue for the future of Slovakia.
SMER - social democracy here sees as key problems the possibility of employment of young people, securing their housing and improving the conditions for starting a family and caring for children.
The goal is for a young person to gain the necessary work experience and experience to be able to successfully enter the labor market, and for young families to meet their most basic needs, which are housing and childcare.
SMER - social democracy will therefore promote the following: - by means of levy incentives, employers are motivated to hire school graduates; for at least 1 year, the labor office would pay the employer levies for a new employee - a school graduate; this would give the young person the necessary experience and work habits in their first job;
- legislative changes in the area of ​​mortgage loans and the State Housing Development Fund increased the availability of mortgage loans and loans from the state fund;
SMER - social democracy is considering re-introduction of a state contribution to a mortgage loan, which would be targeted assistance for young families;
the form of contribution would be a state social support benefit, which would be paid from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment chapter based on address criteria;
SMER - social democracy will also strive to expand the possibilities of using the State Housing Development Fund;
- introduced a marriage loan that would be provided by the State Housing Development Fund;
its goal is to provide a young family with a certain financial amount, a maximum of 200,000 Sk from the State Housing Development Fund, e.g. for construction modifications of an apartment or house, for household equipment and other needs;
-radically increased support for young families upon the birth of a child;
since the amount of the contribution at the birth of a child is disproportionately low, SMER - social democracy will push for a significant increase in the contribution at the birth of the first child, to at least 15,000 Sk and a more significant inter-annual valorization of the basic benefit;
significantly increased the amount of the parental allowance, which is provided to the parent if he takes proper care of the child; the current amount of the parental allowance of SKK 4,230 is not enough for the parent to cover the needs of the household and their child;
therefore, SMER - social democracy will push for the amount of the parental allowance to reach the level of the minimum wage by 2010;
DIRECTION - social democracy will push to allow working parents to receive the full amount of parental allowance if the child attends a nursery school or nursery school;
-increased the enforceability of alimony in Slovakia;
DIRECTION – social democracy will advocate, especially in matters of alimony, to shorten the length of court proceedings;
in matters of alimony for a minor child, it is inadmissible that more than 10,000 kroner costs of an unsuccessful execution be paid by the beneficiary, i.e. most often the mother who claims alimony for her child;
therefore, SMER - social democracy will push for a change, on the basis of which the costs of unsuccessful executions in matters of alimony will be covered by the state;
-expanded the options for substitute maintenance;
SMER - social democracy will push for this hard-fought law to be expanded to include additional options for providing replacement alimony in the event of non-payment of alimony by the child's second parent;
- established the Committee of Ministers for Children and Youth under the leadership of the Prime Minister;
its aim will be to ensure that the state protects the rights of children and youth, to influence the creation of legislation on these issues and to propose solutions to problems in the field of social security for children, health protection, support for leisure activities and sports, and the fight against drugs and child abuse.
3. RULE OF LAW
SMER - social democracy considers it extremely important to build citizens' trust in the ability of the state and its bodies to deal with large-scale cases of economic crime and political corruption, to protect their lives, health, freedom, property and other rights, and to ensure basic equality before the law.
Serious economic crime and corruption
In the area of ​​serious economic crime and corruption, SMER - social democracy must note a fundamental shift compared to the period up to 1998.
The damage caused to state property is higher, the number of financial and corruption scandals is increasing without any accountability, and more and more sophisticated ways to rob the state are emerging, often under the direct supervision of government politicians.
SMER - social democracy: - evaluate the effectiveness of special legal instruments and institutions in the fight against the most serious economic crime and corruption and do everything necessary to end the period of political interference in their work;
- will make every effort to bring into force the law on proving the origin of property, which was challenged by a group of members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic before the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic;
Slovakia vitally needs a legal mechanism, on the basis of which it will be possible to resort to the property of persons unable to prove the origin of their wealth in civil proceedings;
-in the fight against political corruption in the form of buying independent deputies, he will push for a change in the electoral system so that at least half of the deputies are elected in single-mandate constituencies, in which voters would have the right to remove a deputy from his mandate even during the election period.
Safety of citizens
In the fight against other crimes, SMER - social democracy will consistently enforce: - a combination of repressive and preventive mechanisms with an emphasis on the prevention of anti-social activity, which practically does not exist in Slovakia;
crime prevention with the involvement of the state and its bodies, public-law media, regional and local self-government, non-governmental organizations and the public will form the basis of the criminal policy of the party SMER – social democracy in case of participation in the government;
- necessary corrections of errors in the recoded Criminal Code and Criminal Code caused by the unqualified approach of the Slovak government to the preparation of draft criminal codes;
-severe punishment and isolation of dangerous criminals from society, with the simultaneous wide use of alternative punishments carried out at liberty, which significantly relieve the public budget of spending on prisons;
at the same time, it will promote the highest possible employment of persons sentenced to imprisonment, also by ensuring that prison workplaces will participate more actively in the implementation of appropriate state contracts;
-first-class care for victims of crimes, which must become the focus of the entire penal system, and expanding the conditions for their state compensation;
- preservation of social guarantees for police officers, prosecutors and judges with the aim of maximally stabilizing their position;
DIRECTION - social democracy respects the roles and position of the municipal police, but its strengthening cannot be at the expense of the state police, which must respond to new forms of crime;
- the current form of the prosecutor's office as an institution independent of the executive power.
In the area of ​​citizen safety, SMER - social democracy will pay ongoing attention to the position and conditions in which the Fire and Rescue Service works. SMER - social democracy is for a fundamental improvement of the social status and working conditions of firefighters and rescuers, whose mission and risky working conditions are not sufficiently appreciated.
SMER - social democracy, in order to obtain the necessary financial means to fulfill this goal, will proceed to increase the contribution of commercial insurance companies to a special fund intended for financing the technical equipment of firefighters and paramedics.
SMER - social democracy perceives the unpreparedness of the state to respond consistently and effectively to natural disasters (primarily floods) and the neglect of preventive measures as a particularly serious situation.
SMER - social democracy will therefore: - evaluate the capacity of the state and its bodies to respond to the threat of a possible terrorist attack and the consequences of such an attack and take the necessary measures to improve the preparedness of the state to anticipate and avert the threat of a terrorist attack and eliminate its possible consequences.
- tighten the procedure against extremism.
Right of access to court and equality before the law
SMER - social democracy sees huge differences in the realization of the right to access to court and equality before the law.
SMER - social democracy therefore: - during the entire election period will not increase court fees, which are an important factor influencing people's access to judicial protection; where it will be effective, he will proceed to reduce them;
- will promote legal equality among citizens by further expanding the possibilities of free legal aid for the poor and for this purpose will support the activities of non-governmental organizations;
-evaluates the effectiveness of the Public Defender of Rights and proposes the extension of his powers so that he can act more actively and effectively in cases of obvious injustice;
- will support increased material and personnel support for courts and increased responsibility for delays in court proceedings caused by subjective reasons;
-in the business-legal agenda, it will significantly support all options for out-of-court dispute resolution.
Stable and high-quality legislation
SMER - social democracy considers stable and high-quality legislation to be an indispensable part of the rule of law.
Therefore: - will adapt the legislative program of the new government mainly to the priorities of the government program with the aim of reducing the number of government legislative proposals and increasing their quality;
- the most important draft laws will be submitted for public discussion and will not allow the adoption of laws in an abbreviated legislative procedure if the legal conditions for such a procedure are not met.
4. FOREIGN POLICY
SMER - social democracy considers foreign policy to be one of the basic tools for promoting the national interests of the Slovak Republic.
It supports Slovakia's active participation in European political and economic, as well as transatlantic structures, because Slovakia is an integral part of Europe.
Several successes were achieved in foreign policy, but on the other hand, Slovakia lost a lot, for example in fulfilling the conditions for joining the EU, when Slovak diplomacy did not negotiate optimal conditions.
After Slovakia's membership in NATO and the EU, the government's foreign policy seems to have lost its motivation.
The current stagnation and the government's satisfaction with the results of foreign policy is a serious obstacle for Slovakia in the pursuit of its goals.
Foreign policy cannot only be a tool for building the political prestige of government representation.
The world has four cardinal points.
Therefore, the foreign policy of the party SMER - social democracy will be oriented towards the west, as well as towards the east, north and south.
SMER - social democracy recognizes the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in maintaining stability in the world
and confirms the will to fulfill Slovakia's obligations in NATO.
It condemns terrorism and supports the collective struggle against all its forms.
