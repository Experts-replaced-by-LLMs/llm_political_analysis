The manifesto stresses that state budget funds, sourced from taxpayers, should not be misused for political corruption, vote-buying, or propaganda. Instead, they advocate for the allocation of public money solely for actions that serve the common good.

The manifesto introduces a program called "Lower Taxes, Higher Wages," aimed at increasing the net income of lower-earning individuals by reducing their tax burden. .

The manifesto proposes to simplify the tax system for businesses. They propose a single tax and social security payment instead of multiple transactions.

They suggest restructuring the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) to a model where companies only pay taxes on profits when they are distributed to shareholders, not when they are reinvested in the business.

The manifesto proposes to increase public spending on healthcare. 

The manifesto calls for significant investment in education, including higher salaries for teachers, modernized school infrastructure, and a focus on practical skills and digital competencies. 

The party aims to support the elderly by increasing pensions and providing incentives for older individuals to remain in the workforce. They propose exempting working pensioners from income tax on their pensions.

The party acknowledges that their proposed tax cuts and increased public spending will require careful financial management. They plan to achieve this by:

- Reducing public debt to below 30% of GDP by 2030.
- Implementing a ban on excessive borrowing during periods of economic growth.
- Ensuring that any increase in public spending is matched by corresponding increases in revenue or savings from other areas.

In summary, the manifesto focuses on reducing the tax burden on lower-income individuals and small businesses, increasing public spending on healthcare and education, and implementing environmental protection measures. They aim to balance these initiatives with prudent financial management to ensure long-term economic stability.
