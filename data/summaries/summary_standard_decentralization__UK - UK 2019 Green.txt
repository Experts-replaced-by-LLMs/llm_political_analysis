The Green Party's manifesto emphasizes a strong pro-decentralization stance, advocating for significant legislative, fiscal, and administrative autonomy for regional and local governments. The party aims to empower local councils with increased funding, decision-making powers, and responsibilities, particularly in areas such as public transport, housing, social care, and environmental improvements. The manifesto also calls for reforms to the electoral system to ensure fair representation and greater participation in democracy, as well as measures to enhance transparency and accountability in government.
