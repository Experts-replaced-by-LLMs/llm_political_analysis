**Summary of the "Siderov Plan" by the Ataka Party**

**1. The European Union and European Integration:**
- The manifesto criticizes the European Union (EU) for its economic failures and compares it to a new Soviet Union, working forcefully and unconstitutionally.
- It questions whether Bulgaria should continue being a member of the EU in its current form, suggesting that the EU threatens democracy and national sovereignty.
- The manifesto calls for sending true nationalists to EU structures to fight for restructuring the Union rather than becoming pawns of global politics.
- It criticizes the European Pact signed by the Bulgarian government, claiming it increases the power of supranational banking and corporate oligarchy and undermines national sovereignty.

**2. Taxation, Public Spending, and Trade-offs:**
- The plan proposes a significant increase in minimum wages and pensions to 1000 BGN and 500 BGN respectively, immediately, not in 25 years.
- It advocates for the annulment of concession contracts for gold mining and energy companies, aiming to return profits to the Bulgarian nation.
- The manifesto suggests creating a state bank for quick and cheap credit to small and medium-sized businesses and a cooperative bank for agriculture with initial state funding.
- It emphasizes the need for a new customs regulation to curb smuggling and return 2 billion euros annually to the Bulgarian economy.

**3. Social and Lifestyle Policies:**
- The manifesto does not explicitly address issues related to homosexuality or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The focus is more on economic and nationalistic policies.
