#### Social Policies

- **Abortion Rights**
  - The manifesto does not explicitly mention abortion rights, but the Green Party has historically supported reproductive rights and access to safe, legal abortion services.

- **LGBTQ+ Rights**
  - **Marriage Equality:** The Green Party supports marriage equality and has been a long-time advocate for LGBTQ+ rights.
  - **Adoption Rights:** The manifesto does not specifically mention adoption rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, but the party's inclusive stance suggests support for equal adoption rights.
  - **Anti-Discrimination Laws:** The Green Party is committed to tackling discrimination and exclusion, advocating for comprehensive anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTQ+ individuals.
  - **Healthcare:** Increase funding for areas of the NHS heavily relied on by LGBTQ+ people, including trans healthcare, gender identity clinics, HIV treatment, and mental health provision.
  - **Education:** Properly fund training to support the delivery of comprehensive, age-appropriate Personal Health and Sexual Education (PHSE) lessons in schools covering all aspects of sex and relationships, with a focus on consent. End the opt-out of LGBTQ+ inclusive PHSE classes at school to ensure that every child learns about different types of couples and families that make up UK society.
  - **Legal Recognition:** Remove the spousal veto so that married trans people can acquire their gender recognition certificate without having to obtain permission from their spouse. Change the law so an X gender marker can be added to passports for non-binary and intersex people who wish to use it. Update the Gender Recognition Act to allow trans youth and non-binary people to get legal recognition through self-declaration.

- **Anti-Discrimination and Equality**
  - Establish a cross-government strategy tasked with tackling ethnic inequalities, ranging from school exclusions through to biased treatment in the criminal justice system, and covering housing, employment, and health.
  - Replace ‘Prevent’ with community cohesive policing which engages rather than antagonises Black Minority Ethnic (BME) communities and addresses concerns about the use of stop and search powers.
  - End the hostile environment which puts migrants, from the EU and further afield, at risk and increases racism and anti-immigrant sentiment.
  - Create a new Ministry for the Interior that will be fully committed to upholding human rights, including protecting the fundamental rights of Travellers.
  - Make a ‘Windrush Day’ bank holiday to celebrate the contribution that migration has made to society.
  - Bring forward a new humane immigration system with no minimum income rules for visas, full workplace rights for migrants, the right to work for asylum seekers, and recourse to public support for migrants and asylum seekers who need it.
  - Confront racism, antisemitism, and prejudice, including from an early age through a broader and decolonialised curriculum in school.
  - Guarantee safe and discreet access to public services such as the police, health, and education, so that migrants can access these without fear of being subject to immigration enforcement.
  - Abolish the draconian powers brought in under the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts and scrap health charging for migrants.
  - Defend the right of people of all faiths to express their faith, including in religious clothing, food, or reasonable accommodation of religious observance.
  - Retain the Human Rights Act and reaffirm the UK’s commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights.
  - Make misogyny a hate crime across the UK and increase the police’s capacity to deal with domestic violence and misogynistic hate crimes.
  - Develop and implement a UK-wide strategy to tackle gender-based violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual abuse, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and trafficking.
  - Reverse cuts to legal aid to prevent survivors from being forced to represent themselves against their abusers in court and introduce a new Domestic Abuse Bill, which enables prosecution of economic abuse.
  - Roll back the cuts to domestic violence support centres and women’s refuges, and increase funding to provide more safe and secure accommodation for women and their children.
  - Put funding for Rape Crisis Centre services on a sustainable footing so that every survivor of sexual assault or violence receives proper support.
  - Establish a new press regulatory regime which will allow women to make formal complaints about media coverage that encourages misogyny against women.
