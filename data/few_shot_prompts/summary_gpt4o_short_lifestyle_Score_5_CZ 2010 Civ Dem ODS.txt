The manifesto advocates policies that support families with children, including tax benefits and flexible parental leave options. It proposes a "two-speed" maternity leave system, allowing parents to choose between a shorter, fully paid leave or a longer, partially paid leave.

The manifesto also highlights the need for new family-oriented services, such as company-sponsored childcare and private mini-kindergartens, to complement existing public childcare facilities. This approach aims to provide parents with more choices in balancing work and family responsibilities.

In terms of social support, the manifesto stresses the importance of a targeted and fair social system that assists those genuinely in need, such as the disabled, the elderly, and parents with young children. The party is committed to preventing the abuse of social benefits and ensuring that recipients fulfill their obligations.

Overall, the manifesto reflects a commitment to traditional family values, with a focus on supporting families and ensuring the responsible use of social benefits.  It does not directly address social and lifestyle issues such as abortion, LGBTQ+ issues.
